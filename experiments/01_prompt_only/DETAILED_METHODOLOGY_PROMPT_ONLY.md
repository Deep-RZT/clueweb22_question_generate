# Methodology Documentation: PROMPT-Only Approach

## üéØ Overview

The PROMPT-only approach represents the most straightforward question generation methodology, relying entirely on the intrinsic knowledge and reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) without external knowledge retrieval.

## üîß Technical Framework

### Core Pipeline
```
Raw Documents ‚Üí Domain Analysis ‚Üí Domain Report Generation ‚Üí Research Question Generation ‚Üí Answer Generation
```

### Detailed Process

1. **Document Preprocessing**
   - Load ClueWeb22 or academic paper datasets
   - Aggregate multiple document contents (typically 100 documents/topic)
   - Text cleaning and format standardization

2. **Domain Identification & Analysis**
   ```python
   # Specialized domain identification prompts
   domain_prompt = """
   Analyze the following document collection and identify:
   - Primary research domains and characteristics
   - Technical features and innovations
   - Application areas and use cases
   - Research frontiers and emerging trends
   """
   ```

3. **Comprehensive Report Generation**
   - Generate 1500-2000 word domain reports based on document content
   - Include technical background, current developments, challenges & opportunities
   - Provide knowledge foundation for subsequent question generation

4. **Tiered Question Generation**
   - **Easy Level (20%)**: Basic concepts and definition questions
   - **Medium Level (40%)**: Analysis and synthesis questions
   - **Hard Level (40%)**: Deep thinking and cross-domain knowledge questions

## üìä Technical Characteristics

### ‚úÖ Advantages
- **Simple & Efficient**: No external knowledge base required, easy implementation
- **Rapid Deployment**: Only API keys needed for operation
- **Self-Contained**: Independent of domain-specific data
- **High Flexibility**: Can process documents from any domain

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations
- **Knowledge Boundaries**: Limited by LLM training data temporal constraints
- **Potential Hallucination**: May generate inaccurate information
- **Limited Depth**: Lacks latest specialized knowledge
- **Consistency Challenges**: Different runs may yield inconsistent results

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Details

### Key Parameter Configuration
```python
class ClueWeb22SimplifiedGenerator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.max_tokens = 4000          # Output token limit
        self.temperature = 0.3          # Creativity control
        self.documents_per_topic = 100  # Documents per topic
        self.questions_per_topic = 50   # Questions per topic
```

### Prompt Engineering Strategy

#### 1. Domain Report Generation Prompt
```python
domain_report_prompt = f"""
You are a senior research analyst. Based on the following {len(documents)} documents,
generate a comprehensive research report of 1500-2000 words.

The report should include:
1. Domain background and definitions
2. Current state of technological development
3. Major challenges and issues
4. Future development directions
5. Application prospect analysis

Please ensure the report is academic and professional.
"""
```

#### 2. Question Generation Prompt
```python
question_prompt = f"""
Based on the above domain report, generate {num_questions} high-quality research questions.

Requirements:
- Easy level ({easy_count} questions): Basic questions with 400-600 word answers
- Medium level ({medium_count} questions): Analytical questions with 800-1200 word answers
- Hard level ({hard_count} questions): Comprehensive questions with 1500+ word answers

Format:
Q1: [Question content]
DIFFICULTY: Easy/Medium/Hard
TYPE: [Question type]
REASONING: [Question design rationale]
"""
```

### Quality Control Mechanisms

1. **Content Validation**: Check relevance of generated questions
2. **Difficulty Balance**: Ensure difficulty distribution meets requirements
3. **Duplicate Detection**: Avoid generating duplicate or similar questions
4. **Format Standardization**: Unified output format
