    "abstract": "Australia has one of the highest per capita consumption of energy and\nemissions of greenhouse gases in the world. It is also the global leader in\nrapid per capita annual deployment of new solar and wind energy, which is\ncausing the country's emissions to decline. Australia is located at\nlow-moderate latitudes along with three quarters of the global population.\nThese factors make the Australian experience globally significant. In this\nstudy, we model a fully decarbonised electricity system together with complete\nelectrification of heating, transport and industry in Australia leading to an\n80% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. An energy supply-demand balance is\nsimulated based on long-term (10 years), high-resolution (half-hourly)\nmeteorological and energy demand data. A significant feature of this model is\nthat short-term off-river energy storage and distributed energy storage are\nutilised to support the large-scale integration of variable solar and wind\nenergy. The results show that high levels of energy reliability and\naffordability can be effectively achieved through a synergy of flexible energy\nsources; interconnection of electricity grids over large areas; response from\ndemand-side participation; and mass energy storage. This strategy represents a\nrapid and generic pathway towards zero-carbon energy futures within the\nSunbelt.",

    "abstract": "As the world seeks to transition to a sustainable energy future, energy\nstorage technologies are increasingly recognized as critical enablers. However,\nthe macro-energy system assessment of energy storage has often focused on\nisolated storage technologies and neglected competition between them, thus\nleaving out which energy storage to prioritise. The article applies a\nsystematic deployment analysis method that enables system-value evaluation in\nperfect competitive markets and demonstrates its application to 20 different\nenergy storage technologies across 40 distinct scenarios for a representative\nfuture power system in Africa. Here, each storage solution is explored alone\nand in competition with others, examining specific total system costs,\ndeployment configuration, and cost synergies between the storage technologies.\nThe results demonstrate the significant benefits of optimizing energy storage\nwith competition compared to without (+10% cost savings), and highlight the\nrelevance of several energy storage technologies in different scenarios. This\nwork provides insights into the role of energy storage in decarbonizing power\nsystems and informs future research and policy decisions. There is no\none-size-fits-all energy storage, but rather an ideal combination of multiple\nenergy storage options designed and operated in symbiosis.",

    "abstract": "In the studies of piezoelectric energy harvesting (PEH) systems, literature\nhas shown that circuit advancement has a significant effect on the enhancement\nof energy harvesting capability in resonance. On the other hand, some recent\nstudies using the phase-variable (PV) synchronized switch technologies have\nfound that the advanced circuit solutions can also broaden the harvesting\nbandwidth. However, the available span of the electrically induced dynamics by\nthe existing energy harvesting circuits was not properly defined and\ndemonstrated. Performance comparison among different circuits cannot be fairly\nachieved without using a common theoretical language. Given these, this paper\nprovides an impedance-based analysis and comparison on the electromechanical\njoint dynamics of the PEH systems using different interface circuits. Given\nthat the resonance tunability by circuit solutions has received no attention in\nthe conventional ideal model of kinetic energy harvester, we firstly propose a\nmore inclusive ideal model for better generalization. In practice, it was\nproven that the attainable dynamic ranges of the practical energy harvesting\ncircuits are only some subsets of the ideal realm. A detailed quantitative\nstudy on the attainable ranges of the PV circuit solutions is provided after\nthe introduction of the ideal target. Simulation and experimental results of\ndifferent interface circuits show good agreement with the theoretical analysis.\nIt can be concluded that the resonance tunability strongly depends on the\nachievable extent in the reactive direction of the equivalent impedance plane.\nIn practice, the electromechanical coupling conditions and dielectric loss\nmight also influence the resonance tunability. The general ideal model and\nquantitative impedance analysis provided in this paper help guide the future\ndesign effort towards high-capability and broadband PEH systems.",

    "abstract": "A whole-system, investment-optimising model has been used to examine the\nchange in total cost of meeting demand for electricity when Smart Local Energy\nSystems (SLES) are deployed. Our assumption is that SLES, alongside their other\nfeatures, enhance the flexibility of electricity consumption through\ndemand-side response (DSR) and facilitate use of local energy storage. We find\nthat with the flexibility of SLES present, variable renewables such as offshore\nwind can displace firm but more expensive low-carbon sources such as CCS.\nConsidering a 100 gCO2/kWh emissions target in 2030, a 10% penetration of SLES\ncould reduce total costs by {\\pounds}1.2bn/year relative to no SLES, while at\nhigher penetration of 50% SLES, savings increase twofold to\n{\\pounds}2.8bn/year. Under a more stringent emissions limit of 25 gCO2/kWh in\n2040, the savings rise to {\\pounds}2.9bn/year for 10% SLES uptake and rise\nthreefold to {\\pounds}8.7bn/year at 50% uptake. These results hold for costs of\nenabling DSR of less than {\\pounds}100/kW and it is not until an unlikely\n{\\pounds}5,000/kW that the savings are nullified. The savings from substituting\nwind for CCS remain substantial even if the anticipated reduction of cost of\nwind in 2040 does not materialise. Cost savings from the flexibility provided\nby SLES are affected by realisation of domestic DSR through other means. A 20%\nuptake level of non-SLES DSR in 2040 still allows SLES to create cost savings\nof {\\pounds}6.8bn/year at 50% penetration (a 20% fall from\n{\\pounds}8.7bn/year).",

    "abstract": "In this article, we present an analysis of the effects of nonlinear circuits\non bistable vibration energy harvesters. We begin by introducing an analytical\nmodel for bistable vibration energy harvesters and demonstrate that the impact\nof nonlinear circuits can be characterized by two factors: electrically-induced\ndamping and electrically-induced stiffness. Subsequently, we investigate how\nthese factors influence the power-frequency response of the harvester. Our\nfindings reveal that electrically-induced damping significantly affects the\nbistable vibration energy harvester dynamics, whereas electrically-induced\nstiffness has minimal impact, which is a notable difference from the behavior\nof linear harvesters connected to nonlinear circuits. Thereafter, we conduct a\ncomparative study of bistable energy harvesters connected to different\nnonlinear circuits already well documented in the literature. Our analysis\ndemonstrates that, in most cases, the parallel synchronized switch harvesting\non inductor circuit yields superior performance due to its ability to maximize\nelectrically-induced damping. These comparative assessments and conclusions are\nevaluated within the framework of our proposed models and are contrasted with\nresults obtained from linear vibration energy harvesters. The derived\ncomparison maps presented at the end of this paper offer quantitative\njustification for selecting the optimal circuit for bistable energy harvesters,\nwhile deepening our comprehension of the intricate dynamics associated with\nnonlinear harvesters coupled with nonlinear circuits.",

    "abstract": "An energy storage technology is valuable if it makes energy systems cheaper.\nTraditional ways to improve storage technologies are to reduce their costs;\nhowever, the cheapest energy storage is not always the most valuable in energy\nsystems. Modern techno-economical evaluation methods try to address the cost\nand value situation but do not judge the competitiveness of multiple\ntechnologies simultaneously. This paper introduces the market potential method\nas a new complementary valuation method guiding innovation of multiple energy\nstorage. The market potential method derives the value of technologies by\nexamining common deployment signals from energy system model outputs in a\nstructured way. We apply and compare this method to cost evaluation approaches\nin a renewables-based European power system model, covering diverse energy\nstorage technologies. We find that characteristics of high-cost hydrogen\nstorage can be more valuable than low-cost hydrogen storage. Additionally, we\nshow that modifying the freedom of storage sizing and component interactions\ncan make the energy system 10% cheaper and impact the value of technologies.\nThe results suggest looking beyond the pure cost reduction paradigm and focus\non developing technologies with suitable value approaches that can lead to\ncheaper electricity systems in future.",

    "abstract": "In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic spreads all over the world. In order to\nalleviate the spread of the epidemic, various blockade policies have been\nimplemented in many areas. In order to formulate a better epidemic prevention\npolicy for urban energy consumption of the commercial tourism cities, this\npaper first analyses the energy characteristics of Macao during the epidemic\nperiod from two aspects, based on the energy consumption data of Macao. On this\nbasis, the power consumption characteristics of commercial tourism cities\nduring the epidemic were analyzed. Then, this paper provides analysis of the\ncharacteristics of the energy consumption in different fields of commercial\ntourism cities from the aspects of hotel, transportation, tourism culture and\npublic utilities. Finally, a detailed analysis of the energy consumption\ncharacteristics of commercial tourism cities represented by Macao during the\nepidemic period is provided, by comparing with some typical countries.",

    "abstract": "Energy system models based on linear programming have been growing in size\nwith the increasing need to model renewables with high spatial and temporal\ndetail. Larger models lead to high computational requirements. Furthermore,\nseemingly small changes in a model can lead to drastic differences in runtime.\nHere, we investigate measures to address this issue. We review the mathematical\nstructure of a typical energy system model, and discuss issues of sparsity,\ndegeneracy and large numerical range. We introduce and test a method to\nautomatically scale models to improve numerical range. We test this method as\nwell as tweaks to model formulation and solver preferences, finding that\nadjustments can have a substantial impact on runtime. In particular, the\nbarrier method without crossover can be very fast, but affects the structure of\nthe resulting optimal solution. We conclude with a range of recommendations for\nenergy system modellers.",

    "abstract": "Seasonal climate variations affect electricity demand, which in turn affects\nmonth-to-month electricity planning and operations. Electricity system planning\nat the monthly timescale can be improved by adapting climate forecasts to\nestimate electricity demand and utilizing energy models to estimate monthly\nelectricity generation and associated operational costs. The objective of this\npaper is to develop and test a computationally efficient model that can support\nseasonal planning while preserving key aspects of system operation over hourly\nand daily timeframes. To do so, an energy system optimization model is\nrepurposed for seasonal planning using features drawn from a unit commitment\nmodel. Different scenarios utilizing a well-known test system are used to\nevaluate the errors associated with both the repurposed energy system model and\nan imperfect load forecast. The results show that the energy system\noptimization model using an imperfect load forecast produces differences in\nmonthly cost and generation levels that are less than 2% compared with a unit\ncommitment model using a perfect load forecast. The enhanced energy system\noptimization model can be solved approximately 100 times faster than the unit\ncommitment model, making it a suitable tool for future work aimed at evaluating\nseasonal electricity generation and demand under uncertainty.",

    "title": "FOCUS : A framework for energy system optimization from prosumer to district and city scale",
    "abstract": "Decarbonizing the energy sector is one of the main challenges to combat the\nclimate crisis. Cities play an important role to reach climate neutrality as\nmore than 70% of global CO2 emissions originate from urban areas.\nDecarbonization of energy supply systems can be achieved through various means,\nincluding the use of renewable energy sources, improving the efficiency of\ntechnologies, the coupling of different energy sectors, and the use of\nflexibility considering individual prosumer behaviour. This leads to an\nincreasingly decentralized energy system, which is challenging to operate in a\nrobust and cost-effective way. The evaluation of technologies and subsystems\ncan only be done from the perspective of the system in which it is embedded and\nit is highly dependent on their networking and application scenarios.\nTherefore, the design and operation of energy systems require adequate\ncomputation and evaluation tools, which offer a holistic view of all\ninterconnected components. The currently available optimization tools have\nlimitations, such as limited scope of technologies and sectors, high\nrequirements on data, high computational cost, and difficulty in handling\nmulti-objective optimization. To overcome these limitations a software\nframework called FOCUS for the flexible and dynamic modeling of any urban\nsector-coupled energy system is developed. The framework includes a library\ncontaining models for different technologies and offers a variety of parameter\nsets for each technology. FOCUS can handle multi-objective problems by\nreturning Pareto-optimal fronts, which helps users to discover the trade-off\nbetween criteria and objectives. The developed tool can identify new\nflexibility potentials in the energy system, actively support companies in the\nrespective field to optimize urban energy system planning solutions, and\ndetermine possible threads to the stable operation of such systems.",

    "abstract": "This paper considers the problem of shaping agent utility functions in a\ntransactive energy system to ensure the optimal energy price at a competitive\nequilibrium is always socially acceptable, that is, below a prescribed\nthreshold. Agents in a distributed energy system aim to maximize their\nindividual payoffs, as a combination of the utility of energy consumption and\nthe income/expenditure from energy exchange. The utility function of each agent\nis parameterized by individual preference vectors, with the overall system\noperating at competitive equilibriums. We show the social shaping problem of\nthe proposed transactive energy system is conceptually captured by a set\ndecision problem. The set of agent preferences that guarantees a socially\nacceptable price is characterized by an implicit algebraic equation for\nstrictly concave and continuously differentiable utility functions. We also\npresent two analytical solutions where tight ranges for the coefficients of\nlinear-quadratic utilities and piece-wise linear utilities are established\nunder which optimal pricing is proven to be always socially acceptable.",

    "title": "A Hetero-functional Graph Structural Analysis of the American Multi-modal Energy System",
    "abstract": "As one of the most pressing challenges of the 21st century, global climate\nchange demands a host of changes across four critical energy infrastructures:\nthe electric grid, the natural gas system, the oil system, and the coal system.\nUnfortunately, these four systems are often studied individually, and rarely\ntogether as integrated systems. Instead, holistic multi-energy system models\ncan serve to improve the understanding of these interdependent systems and\nguide policies that shape the systems as they evolve into the future. The NSF\nproject entitled \"American Multi-Modal Energy System Synthetic \\& Simulated\nData (AMES-3D)\" seeks to fill this void with an open-source,\nphysically-informed, structural and behavioral machine-learning model of the\nAMES. To that end, this paper uses a GIS-data-driven, model-based system\nengineering approach to develop structural models of the American Multi-Modal\nEnergy System (AMES). This paper produces and reports the hetero-functional\nincidence tensor, hetero-functional adjacency matrix, and the formal graph\nadjacency matrix in terms of their statistics. This work compares these four\nhetero-functional graph models across the states of New York (NY), California\n(CA), Texas (TX), and the United States of America (USA) as a whole. From the\nreported statistics, the paper finds that the geography and the sustainable\nenergy policies of these states are deeply reflected in the structure of their\nmulti-energy infrastructure systems and impact the full USA's structure.",

    "abstract": "This research details outcomes from a global model which estimates future\nhydrogen penetration into a carbon constrained energy system to the year 2050.\nFocusing on minimum and maximum penetration scenarios, an investigation of\nglobal fuel cell vehicle (FCV) deployment is undertaken, cognizant of optimal\neconomic deployment at the global level and stakeholder preferences in a case\nstudy of Japan. The model is mathematically formulated as a very large-scale\nlinear optimization problem, aiming to minimize system costs, including\ngeneration type, fuel costs, conversion costs, and carbon reduction costs,\nsubject to the constraint of carbon dioxide reductions for each nation. Results\nshow that between approximately 0.8% and 2% of global energy consumption needs\ncan be met by hydrogen out to the year 2050, with city gas and transport\nemerging as significant use cases. Passenger FCVs and hydrogen buses account\nfor almost all of the hydrogen-based transportation sector, leading to a global\ndeployment of approximately 120 million FCVs by 2050. Hydrogen production is\nreliant on fossil fuels, and OECD nations are net importers - especially Japan\nwith a 100% import case. To underpin hydrogen production from fossil fuels,\ncarbon capture and storage (CCS) is required in significant quantities when\nanticipating a large fleet of FCVs. Stakeholder engagement suggests optimism\ntoward FCV deployment while policy issues identified include necessity for\nlarge-scale future energy system investment and rapid technical and economic\nfeasibility progress for renewable energy technologies and electrolyzers.",

    "title": "Designing a sector-coupled European energy system robust to 60 years of historical weather data",
    "abstract": "As energy systems transform to rely on renewable energy and electrification,\nthey encounter stronger year-to-year variability in energy supply and demand.\nHowever, most infrastructure planning is based on a single weather year,\nresulting in a lack of robustness. In this paper, we optimize energy\ninfrastructure for a European energy system designed for net-zero CO$_2$\nemissions in 62 different weather years. Subsequently, we fix the capacity\nlayouts and simulate their operation in every weather year, to evaluate\nresource adequacy and CO$_2$ emissions abatement. We show that interannual\nweather variability causes variation of $\\pm$10\\% in total system cost. The\nmost expensive capacity layout obtains the lowest net CO$_2$ emissions but not\nthe highest resource adequacy. Instead, capacity layouts designed with years\nincluding compound weather events result in a more robust and cost-effective\ndesign. Deploying CO$_2$-emitting backup generation is a cost-effective\nrobustness measure, which only increase CO$_2$ emissions marginally as the\naverage CO$_2$ emissions remain less than 1\\% of 1990 levels. Our findings\nhighlight how extreme weather years drive investments in robustness measures,\nmaking them compatible with all weather conditions within six decades of\nhistorical weather data.",

    "title": "Cost and efficiency requirements for a successful electricity storage in a highly renewable European energy system",
    "abstract": "Future highly renewable energy systems might require substantial storage\ndeployment. At the current stage, the technology portfolio of dominant storage\noptions is limited to pumped-hydro storage and Li-Ion batteries. It is\nuncertain which storage design will be able to compete with these options.\nConsidering Europe as a case study, we derive the cost and efficiency\nrequirements of a generic storage technology, which we refer to as storage-X,\nto be deployed in the cost-optimal system. This is performed while including\nexisting pumped-hydro facilities and accounting for the competition from\nstationary Li-ion batteries, flexible generation technology, and flexible\ndemand in a highly renewable sector-coupled energy system. Based on a sample\nspace of 724 storage configurations, we show that energy capacity cost and\ndischarge efficiency largely determine the optimal storage deployment, in\nagreement with previous studies. Here, we show that charge capacity cost is\nalso important due to its impact on renewable curtailment. A significant\ndeployment of storage-X in a cost-optimal system requires (a) discharge\nefficiency of at least 95%, (b) discharge efficiency of at least 50% together\nwith low energy capacity cost (10EUR/kWh), or (c) discharge efficiency of at\nleast 25% with very low energy capacity cost (2EUR/kWh). Comparing our findings\nwith seven emerging technologies reveals that none of them fulfill these\nrequirements. Thermal Energy Storage (TES) is, however, on the verge of\nqualifying due to its low energy capacity cost and concurrent low charge\ncapacity cost. Exploring the space of storage designs reveals that system cost\nreduction from storage-X deployment can reach 9% at its best, but this requires\nhigh round-trip efficiency (90%) and low charge capacity cost (35EUR/kW).",

    "abstract": "In order to reach EU's goal of zero emissions in 2050, the energy system will\ngo through a significant transition over the next decades. To substitute fossil\nenergy carriers, renewable energy sources will be mainly integrated in the\npower system. Thereby, sector coupling will play a major role by making\nflexibility from other sectors such as heat or transport accessible to the\npower system. Planning the cost optimal transition requires a whole-system view\nover multiple horizons and across all sectors. This imposes the need for\nmulti-energy system (MES) models coupled with multi-horizon investment models.\nThis paper presents two multi-horizon planning approaches to determine the cost\noptimal pathway of a MES. As a major contribution, we propose a new method to\nincorporate technology-dependent learning cost curves in the planning problem\nand show that the resulting mixed-integer linear programming problem can be\nsolved faster with a Benders decomposition technique as compared to a closed\noptimization. As a further contribution, we demonstrate the usefulness of our\napproach by showing the MES expansion pathway for a small German test system.",

    "title": "Distributed energy control in electric energy systems",
    "abstract": "The power interactions of any component in electric energy systems with the\nrest of the system happen naturally, as governed by the energy conservation\nprinciples. There may, however, occur instances when the rate at which power\ngets generated by one component through local energy conversion is not exactly\nthe same as that absorbed by rest of the system. This is when instabilities get\ninduced. To model and control such instabilities, this paper generalizes the\nnotion of interaction variable used to characterize diverse system components\nin a unified manner. The same variable captures aggregate system-wide effects\nand sets reference points for multi-layered distributed output feedback\ncontrol. It has a physical interpretation of instantaneous power and\ngeneralized reactive power. The higher layer design utilizes the interactive\nenergy state-space model to derive intermediate reactive power control, which\nbecomes a control command to the lower layer physical model. This command is\nimplemented using either Feedback Linearizing Control (FBLC) or Sliding Mode\nControl (SMC), for which sufficient stability conditions are stated. This paper\nclaims that the proposed design is fundamental to aligning dynamic interactions\nbetween components for stability and feasibility. Without loss of generality,\nwe utilize a simple RLC circuit with a controllable voltage source for\nillustrations, which is a simplified representation of any controllable\ncomponent in microgrids.",

    "abstract": "The revolution of hydraulic fracturing has dramatically increased the supply\nand lowered the cost of natural gas in the United States driving an expansion\nof natural gas-fired generation capacity in many electrical grids. Unrelated to\nthe natural gas expansion, lower capital costs and renewable portfolio\nstandards are driving an expansion of intermittent renewable generation\ncapacity such as wind and photovoltaic generation. These two changes may\npotentially combine to create new threats to the reliability of these\ninterdependent energy infrastructures. Natural gas-fired generators are often\nused to balance the fluctuating output of wind generation. However, the\ntime-varying output of these generators results in time-varying natural gas\nburn rates that impact the pressure in interstate transmission pipelines.\nFluctuating pressure impacts the reliability of natural gas deliveries to those\nsame generators and the safety of pipeline operations. We adopt a partial\ndifferential equation model of natural gas pipelines and use this model to\nexplore the effect of intermittent wind generation on the fluctuations of\npressure in natural gas pipelines. The mean square pressure fluctuations are\nfound to grow linearly in time with points of maximum deviation occurring at\nthe locations of flow reversals.",

    "abstract": "Large scale power failures induced by severe weather have become frequent and\ndamaging in recent years, causing millions of people to be without electricity\nservice for days. Although the power industry has been battling weather-induced\nfailures for years, it is largely unknown how resilient the energy\ninfrastructure and services really are to severe weather disruptions. What\nfundamental issues govern the resilience? Can advanced approaches such as\nmodeling and data analytics help industry to go beyond empirical methods? This\npaper discusses the research to date and open issues related to these\nquestions. The focus is on identifying fundamental challenges and advanced\napproaches for quantifying resilience. In particular, a first aspect of this\nproblem is how to model large-scale failures, recoveries and impacts, involving\nthe infrastructure, service providers, customers, and weather. A second aspect\nis how to identify generic vulnerability (i.e., non-resilience) in the\ninfrastructure and services through large-scale data analytics. And, a third is\nto understand what resilience metrics are needed and how to develop them.",

    "abstract": "Electric vehicles (EVs) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) show great\npotential in modern transportation and communication networks, respectively.\nHowever, with growing demands for such technologies, the limited energy\ninfrastructure becomes the bottleneck for their future growth. It might be of\nhigh cost and low energy efficiency for all the operators to each have their\nown dedicated energy infrastructure, such as charging stations. In this paper,\nwe analyze a wireless charging infrastructure sharing strategy in UAV and\nEV-involved networks. We consider a scenario where UAVs can charge in EV\ncharging stations and pay for the sharing fee. On the EVs' side, sharing\ninfrastructure can earn extra profit but their service quality, such as waiting\ntime, might slightly reduce. On the UAVs' side, if renting EV charging stations\ncan achieve an acceptable system performance, say high coverage probability,\nwhile considering the cost, they may not need to build their dedicated charging\nstations. In this case, we use tools from stochastic geometry to model the\nlocations and propose an optimization problem that captures the aforementioned\ntrade-offs between cost or profit and quality of service. Our numerical results\nshow that sharing infrastructure slightly increases the waiting time of EVs,\nsay within $5$ min, but dramatically decreases the waiting time of drones, say\nmore than $50$ min, and deploying more charging stations do achieve better\nperformances, but all these better performances are expected to cost more.",

To allow for a less centralized\noperating paradigm, consumer-end perspective and abilities should be integrated\nin current dispatch practices and accounted for in switching between different\nenergy sources not only at the system but also at the individual consumer\nlevel.

    "abstract": "This paper presents the development of \"Control-Sync,\" a novel firmware for\nuniversal inverters in microgrids, designed to enhance grid stability and\nflexibility. As hybrid PV-battery systems become increasingly prevalent, there\nis a critical need for inverters capable of efficiently transitioning between\ngrid-forming (GFM) and grid-following (GFL) modes. Our firmware introduces dual\ncontrol paths that allow for seamless transitions without reliance on external\ncontrol devices, reducing communication overhead and increasing operational\nreliability. Key features include direct phase-angle detection and frequency\nrestoration capabilities, essential for managing asymmetrical power grids and\ndynamic load changes.

    "title": "Using Mobile Phone Data for Electricity Infrastructure Planning",
    "abstract": "Detailed knowledge of the energy needs at relatively high spatial and\ntemporal resolution is crucial for the electricity infrastructure planning of a\nregion. However, such information is typically limited by the scarcity of data\non human activities, in particular in developing countries where\nelectrification of rural areas is sought. The analysis of society-wide mobile\nphone records has recently proven to offer unprecedented insights into the\nspatio-temporal distribution of people, but this information has never been\nused to support electrification planning strategies anywhere and for rural\nareas in developing countries in particular. The aim of this project is the\nassessment of the contribution of mobile phone data for the development of\nbottom-up energy demand models, in order to enhance energy planning studies and\nexisting electrification practices. More specifically, this work introduces a\nframework that combines mobile phone data analysis, socioeconomic and\ngeo-referenced data analysis, and state-of-the-art energy infrastructure\nengineering techniques to assess the techno-economic feasibility of different\ncentralized and decentralized electrification options for rural areas in a\ndeveloping country. Specific electrification options considered include\nextensions of the existing medium voltage (MV) grid, diesel engine-based\ncommunity-level Microgrids, and individual household-level solar photovoltaic\n(PV) systems. The framework and relevant methodology are demonstrated\nthroughout the paper using the case of Senegal and the mobile phone data made\navailable for the 'D4D-Senegal' innovation challenge. The results are extremely\nencouraging and highlight the potential of mobile phone data to support more\nefficient and economically attractive electrification plans.",

    "abstract": "The residential electrical energy scheduling of solar Photovoltaics (PV) is\nan important research area of the modern green buildings. On the demand side,\nfactors such as building load, and the renewable PV energy resources are\nintegrated together as a nonlinear, indefinite and time varying complex system,\nwhich is very difficult to forecast and optimize. These energy sources are\ngreatly depending on the climatic conditions. It further makes the residential\nbuilding energy management complex. To address this problem, we present\nstatistical models for the effective utilization of the renewables and reducing\nthe burden on the distribution network. The effect of weather parameters such\nas temperature, dust in the air, humidity and solar irradiation on the green\nbuildings energy infrastructure is taken into account. The details are analyzed\nand presented in the manuscript. The real time data is analyzed in the SPSS\nsoftware tool. The presented results show that the statistical models are\nnecessary for the controller to take action for the efficient and reliable\nintegration of the renewables.",

    "abstract": "This paper explores the impact of electric vehicles (EVs) on traffic\ncongestion and energy consumption by proposing an integrated bi-level framework\ncomprising of: a) a dynamic micro-scale traffic simulation suitable for\nmodelling current and hypothetical traffic and charging demand scenarios and b)\na queue model for capturing the impact of fast charging station use, informed\nby traffic flows, travel distances, availability of charging infrastructure and\nestimated vehicle battery state of charge. To the best of our knowledge, this\npaper represents the first integrated analysis of potential traffic congestion\nand energy infrastructure impacts linked to EV uptake, based on real traffic\nflows and the placement and design of existing fast-charging infrastructure.\nResults showcase that the integrated queue-energy-transport modelling framework\ncan predict correctly the limitations of the EV infrastructure as well as the\ntraffic congestion evolution. The modelling approach identifies concrete pain\npoints to be addressed in both traffic and energy management and planning.

    "title": "Cost-effective Planning of Decarbonized Power-Gas Infrastructure to Meet the Challenges of Heating Electrification",
    "abstract": "Building heat electrification is central to economy-wide decarbonization\nefforts and directly affects energy infrastructure planning through increasing\nelectricity demand and reducing the building sector's use of gas infrastructure\nthat also serves the power sector. Here, we develop a modeling framework to\nquantify end-use demand for electricity and gas in the buildings sector under\nvarious electrification pathways and evaluate their impact on co-optimized bulk\npower-gas infrastructure investments and operations under deep decarbonization\nscenarios. Applying the framework to study the U.S. New England region in 2050\nacross 20 weather scenarios, we find high electrification of the residential\nsector can increase sectoral peak and total electricity demands by up to\n56-158% and 41-59% respectively relative to business-as-usual projections.\nEmploying demand-side measures like building envelope improvements under high\nelectrification, however, can reduce the magnitude and weather sensitivity of\npeak load as well as induce overall efficiency gains, reducing the combined\nresidential sector energy demand for power and gas by 28-30% relative to the\npresent day. Notably, a combination of high electrification and envelope\nimprovements yields the lowest bulk power-gas system cost outcomes. Accounting\nfor \\bt{midstream} methane emissions from gas supply chain increase the\nreliance on low-carbon fuels, which indirectly improves the cost-effectiveness\nof end-use electrification. Similarly, we find that demand flexibility programs\ncan reduce the total system cost by up to 6.3%.",

    "title": "Energy Sharing among Resources within Electrical Distribution Systems: A Systematic Review",
    "abstract": "The rapid increase in Electric Vehicle (EV) adoption provides a promising\nsolution for reducing carbon emissions and fossil fuel dependency in\ntransportation systems. However, the increasing numbers of EVs pose significant\nchallenges to the electrical grids. In addition, the number of Distributed\nEnergy Resources (DER) and Microgrids (MGs) is increasing on a global scale to\nmeet the energy demand, consequently changing the energy infrastructure.\nRecently, energy-sharing methods have been proposed to share excess energy from\nDERs and EVs in Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure (EVCI) and MGs.\nAccommodating this sharing mechanism with the existing electrical distribution\nsystems is a critical issue concerning the economic, reliability, and\nresilience aspects. This study examines the ever-changing field of EVCI and the\ncritical role of peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading in mitigating the problems\nwith grid management that result from unorganized EV charging and intermittency\nin DER. Also, the possibility of energy sharing in electrical distribution\nsystems for microgrids and EVCI on various energy-sharing methods and\nalgorithms are discussed in detail. Furthermore, the application of market\nclearing algorithms like game theory, double auction theory, blockchain\ntechnology, optimization techniques, machine learning algorithms, and other\nmodels from the existing literature are presented. This paper discusses the\npolicies, economic benefits, environmental impacts, societal advantages, and\nchallenges in distribution systems related to sharing in EVCI and MGs. A\nroadmap for future research and sharing strategies is provided to guide\npolicymakers, researchers, and industry stakeholders toward a sustainable,\nresilient, and efficient energy market by integrating P2P technology into EVCIs\nand MGs.",

    "abstract": "The net-zero energy transition is an extraordinary societal challenge. It\nrequires a swift, radical and economy wide transformation. With the aim of\ninforming research and policy, we identify general phases of this transition\nand the overarching strategies that may be brought to bear in tackling this\nchallenge. Drawing from the literature on sustainability transition studies, we\ndepict the net-zero energy transition as a non-linear, cumulative process that\ninvolves multiple, interdependent transitions in different sectors. Future\nemission targets can only be reached if policymaking will play a strong role in\nguiding these transitions. To understand the increasing complexity of the\npolicy challenge, we distinguish four overlapping phases of development:\nemergence of low-carbon innovations, transition of a single sector\n(electricity), transitions of multiple sectors based on low-carbon electricity,\nand transitions in difficult-to-decarbonize sectors. We argue that each phase\ncomes with new policy challenges on top of the already existing ones. Finally,\nwe discuss the merits and limitations of five general strategies for\ndecarbonization: efficiency improvement, low-carbon electrification, low-carbon\nfuels, negative emissions and \"untapped demand-side approaches.\" While\nelectrification has emerged as the dominant strategy, new low-carbon fuels\n(e.g., based on hydrogen) but also more radical changes (e.g., substitution of\ncarbon-intensive products or lifestyle changes) merit further attention.",

    "abstract": "The transition to low-carbon energy systems demands comprehensive evaluation\ntools that account for technical, economic, environmental, and social\ndimensions. While numerous studies address specific aspects of energy\ntransition, few provide an integrated framework that captures the full spectrum\nof impacts. This study proposes a comprehensive techno-economic, environmental,\nand social (TEES) assessment framework to evaluate energy transition pathways.\nThe framework provides a structured methodology for assessing infrastructure\nneeds, cost implications, emissions reductions, and social equity impacts,\noffering a systematic approach for informed decision-making. To illustrate its\napplicability, a detailed case study of a remote community in Alaska is\nconducted, evaluating the TEES impacts of three distinct energy transition\npathways including heat pumps (HPs) and battery integration, resource\ncoordination and expanded community solar photovoltaic (PV). Findings show that\ncoordination of HPs minimizes peak demand, enhances grid reliability, and\nreduces energy burdens among low-income households. Extensive simulation-based\nanalysis reveals that strategically staging electric HPs with existing oil\nheating systems can lower overall energy costs by 19% and reduce emissions by\n29% compared to the today's system and outperforms all-heat-pump strategy for\neconomic savings. By combining a generalizable, community-centric assessment\nframework with data-driven case study insights, this work offers a practical\ntool for utilities, community stakeholders and policymakers to work toward\nequitable and sustainable energy transitions.",

    "title": "European Energy Vision 2060: Charting Diverse Pathways for Europe's Energy Transition",
    "abstract": "Europe is warming at the fastest rate of all continents, experiencing a\ntemperature increase of about 1{\\deg}C higher than the corresponding global\nincrease. Aiming to be the first climate-neutral continent by 2050 under the\nEuropean Green Deal, Europe requires an in-depth understanding of the potential\nenergy transition pathways. In this paper, we develop four qualitative\nlong-term scenarios covering the European energy landscape, considering key\nuncertainty pillars -- categorized under social, technological, economic,\npolitical, and geopolitical aspects. First, we place the scenarios in a\nthree-dimensional space defined by Social dynamics, Innovation, and\nGeopolitical instabilities. These scenarios are brought to life by defining\ntheir narratives and focus areas according to their location in this\nthree-dimensional space. The scenarios envision diverse futures and include\ndistinct features. The EU Trinity scenario pictures how internal divisions\namong EU member states, in the context of global geopolitical instability,\naffect the EU climate targets. The REPowerEU++ scenario outlines the steps\nneeded for a self-sufficient, independent European energy system by 2050. The\nGo RES scenario examines the feasibility of achieving carbon neutrality earlier\nthan 2050 given favourable uncertain factors. The NECP Essentials scenario\nextends current national energy and climate plans until 2060 to assess their\nrole in realizing climate neutrality. The scenarios are extended by\nincorporating policies and economic factors and detailed in a Qualitative to\nQuantitative (Q2Q) matrix, linking narratives to quantification. Finally, two\nscenarios are quantified to illustrate the quantification process. All the\nscenarios are in the process of being quantified and will be openly available\nand reusable.",

    "abstract": "Net-zero emission policies, coupled with declining costs of renewables,\nbattery storage, and electric vehicles, require both direct and indirect\nelectrification (such as green hydrogen) of the energy infrastructure to\naddress climate change impacts, improve resilience, and lower energy expenses.\nIn this paper, a comprehensive techno-economic analysis was performed that\nintegrated net-zero energy buildings within the context of Florida energy\ntransition by the year 2050. The analysis compares the monthly cost savings of\nowning photovoltaic (PV) on the roof, battery storage, and Electric Vehicle\n(EV) to the cost of buying electricity from the grid for both existing and\nnewly built Orlando homes. The impact of income tax credits (ITC) and energy\nefficiency improvements on monthly savings was taken into account. The\nlevelized cost of electricity for residential PV and PV + battery systems was\ndetermined and extended to provide a cost equivalent to gasoline for an average\nEV. Rooftop solar fueling an EV for 10,000 miles saves \\$100 per month over\npurchasing gasoline. Today, Florida residents can save on their monthly costs\nof electricity and gasoline if they have both PV on their roof and a battery\nsystem (sized for average daily residence load), and benefit from the federal\nITC. Florida residents can cost-effectively transition to their own solar,\nbattery storage, and electric vehicle to home systems.

In this\nstudy, we examine three Swiss energy policies, analyzing their impacts on both\nthe national energy system and the cross-border electricity flows. We use a\nmodel inter-comparison approach with four electricity system models to explore\nscenarios involving Swiss renewable generation targets, the Swiss market\nintegration, and the Swiss winter import limitations, in the context of various\nEuropean electricity developments. The results indicate that a renewable\ngeneration target leads to a reduction in net imports and electricity prices.\nAdditionally, reduced market integration impacts both Swiss and European energy\ntransitions by limiting trade benefits, underutilizing Variable Renewable\nEnergy Sources (VRES), and increasing electricity supply costs. Lastly, we\nobserve that limiting Swiss winter imports adversely affects electricity\ntrading, driving up both supply costs and electricity prices.",

The upfront energy\ninvested in constructing a renewable energy infrastructure subtracts from the\nnet energy available for societal energy needs, a fact typically neglected in\nenergy projections. Modeling feasible energy transition pathways to provide\ndifferent net energy levels we find that they are critically dependent on the\nfossil fuel emissions cap and phase-out profile and on the characteristic\nenergy return on energy invested of the renewable energy technologies. The\neasiest pathway requires installation of renewable energy plants to accelerate\nfrom 0.12TWp/year in 2013 to peak between 6.6 and 10.4 TWp/year, for an early\nor a late fossil-fuel phase-out respectively in order for emissions to stay\nwithin the recommended CO2 budget.",

First, we evaluate\nunexpected events assuming \"perfect foresight\", where decision-makers can\nanticipate such events in advance. This allows us to identify dealbreakers,\ni.e., conditions that make the transition infeasible. Then, we assess the\nevents under \"limited foresight\" to evaluate the robustness of early-stage\ndecisions against unforeseen unexpected events and the costs associated with\nmanaging them. A case study for Belgium demonstrates that a lack of electrofuel\nimports in 2050 is the main dealbreaker, while accelerating the deployment of\nrenewables is the most robust policy. Our transferable method can help\npolicymakers identify key dealbreakers and devise robust energy transition\npolicies.",

    "abstract": "The paradox of the energy transition is that the low marginal costs of new\nrenewable energy sources (RES) drag electricity prices down and discourage\ninvestments in flexible productions that are needed to compensate for the lack\nof dispatchability of the new RES. The energy transition thus discourages the\ninvestments that are required for its own harmonious expansion. To investigate\nhow this paradox can be overcome, we argue that, under certain assumptions,\nfuture electricity prices are rather accurately modeled from the residual load\nobtained by subtracting non-flexible productions from the load. Armed with the\nresulting economic indicator, we investigate future revenues for European power\nplants with various degree of flexibility. We find that, if neither carbon\ntaxes nor fuel prices change, flexible productions would be financially\nrewarded better and sooner if the energy transition proceeds faster but at more\nor less constant total production, i.e. by reducing the production of thermal\npower plants at the same rate as the RES production increases. Less flexible\nproductions, on the other hand, would see their revenue grow more moderately.\nOur results indicate that a faster energy transition with a quicker withdrawal\nof thermal power plants would reward flexible productions faster.",

    "title": "A predictive pan-European economic and production dispatch model for the energy transition in the electricity sector",
    "abstract": "The energy transition is well underway in most European countries. It has a\ngrowing impact on electric power systems as it dramatically modifies the way\nelectricity is produced. To ensure a safe and smooth transition towards a\npan-European electricity production dominated by renewable sources, it is of\nparamount importance to anticipate how production dispatches will evolve, to\nunderstand how increased fluctuations in power generations can be absorbed at\nthe pan-European level and to evaluate where the resulting changes in power\nflows will require significant grid upgrades. To address these issues, we\nconstruct an aggregated model of the pan-European transmission network which we\ncouple to an optimized, few-parameter dispatch algorithm to obtain time- and\ngeographically-resolved production profiles. We demonstrate the validity of our\ndispatch algorithm by reproducing historical production time series for all\npower productions in fifteen different European countries. Having calibrated\nour model in this way, we investigate future production profiles at later\nstages of the energy transition - determined by planned future production\ncapacities - and the resulting interregional power flows. We find that large\npower fluctuations from increasing penetrations of renewable sources can be\nabsorbed at the pan-European level via significantly increased electricity\nexchanges between different countries. We identify where these increased\nexchanges will require additional power transfer capacities. We finally\nintroduce a physically-based economic indicator which allows to predict future\nfinancial conditions in the electricity market. We anticipate new economic\nopportunities for dam hydroelectricity and pumped-storage plants.",

    "abstract": "With net-zero emission goals, low-carbon transitions enter a new phase of\ndevelopment, leading to new challenges for policymaking and research. Multiple\ntransitions unfold in parallel across different sectors. This involves a broad\nrange of technologies, while actors engage in increasingly complex discourses.\nHere, we study the discourses on hydrogen in Germany. Based on the analysis of\n179 newspaper articles from 2016 to 2020, we find that a diverse set of actors,\nincluding many industry incumbents, speak favorably about hydrogen, emphasizing\neconomic opportunities and its relevance for the energy transition, whereas\nskeptics highlight its low energy efficiency and expected scarcity. With the\nhelp of discourse network analysis, we identify three emerging conflicts around\nthe use, production, and import of hydrogen. We explain these conflicts and the\nwidespread support of incumbents with a conceptual framework that captures the\ncomplex interplay of sectoral contexts, specific technologies and actor\ninterests.",

    "abstract": "Recent events, including the pandemic, geopolitical conflicts, supply chain\ndisruptions, and climate change impacts, have exposed the critical need to\nensure energy security and resilience in energy systems. We review existing\ndefinitions and interrelations between energy security and resilience,\nconceptualising these terms in the context of energy system transformations. We\nintroduce a classification of disturbances into shock events and slow burn\nprocesses to highlight key challenges to energy system resilience. Examples\nillustrate their distinct impacts on technical, economic, and environmental\nsystem performance over time. We compile relevant recourse options across\nresilience capacity levels and system planning horizons to address these\nchallenges, emphasising actionable strategies for an increasingly integrated\nenergy system. Finally, we propose policy recommendations to integrate shock\nevents and slow burn processes into future energy system planning, enabling\nforward-looking decision-making and system design to analyse and mitigate\npotential disruptions.",

    "title": "Co-optimization of Operational Unit Commitment and Reserve Power Scheduling for Modern Grid",
    "abstract": "Modern power grids combine conventional generators with distributed energy\nresource (DER) generators in response to concerns over climate change and\nlong-term energy security. Due to the intermittent nature of DERs, different\ntypes of energy storage devices (ESDs) must be installed to minimize unit\ncommitment problems and accommodate spinning reserve power. ESDs have\noperational and resource constraints, such as charge and discharge rates or\nmaximum and minimum state of charge (SoC). This paper proposes a linear\nprogramming (LP) optimization framework to maximize the unit-committed power\nfor a specific optimum spinning reserve power for a particular power grid.\nUsing this optimization framework, we also determine the total dispatchable\npower, non-dispatchable power, spinning reserve power, and arbitrage power\nusing DER and ESD resource constraints. To describe the ESD and DER\nconstraints, this paper evaluates several factors: availability,\ndispatchability, non-dispatchability, spinning reserve, and arbitrage factor.\nThese factors are used as constraints in this LP optimization to determine the\ntotal optimal reserve power from the existing DERs. The proposed optimization\nframework maximizes the ratio of dispatchable to non-dispatchable power to\nminimize unit commitment problems within a specific range of spinning reserve\npower set to each DER. This optimization framework is implemented in the\nmodified IEEE 34-bus distribution system, adding ten DERs in ten different\nbuses to verify its efficacy.",

    "abstract": "Localised data aggregation in many countries including Great Britain (GB) is\ntypically done to a geographical level with polygon boundaries that have a\nrobust and trusted governance system in place. At a minimum this will mean\nthere is confidence in a process to create a set of polygons that have unique\nidentifiers coupled to geographical areas, and the ability to have these\nupdated through a defined code of practice. Examples found across many\ncountries are in the delivery of post, such as postcodes and zip codes, and of\nthe definition of census areas and municipal boundaries. The confidence in\nthese boundaries allows different data to be aggregated by third parties, which\nitself provides greater levels of data over comparable geographical areas to\nenhance wider analysis and decision making. Here we combine publicly available\ndatasets published from the six regional electricity Distribution Network\nOperators of GB to produce a new geospatial dataset with 4436 unique polygons\ndefining the areas served by electrical primary substations. An example is also\npresented of the use of these polygons to link postcode level open government\ndatasets on domestic energy consumption (2015-2020) from the Department of\nEnergy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ). This results in another dataset with\nenergy statistics aggregated to the geographical areas served by each primary\nsubstation across Great Britain. Therefore, we believe there is a compelling\nargument for countries to set up processes to create and update polygons that\nhave a meaningful relationship to energy systems. This would allow more\naccurate energy systems analysis to be performed, ultimately leading to an\naccelerated or potentially lower cost transition to a net-zero world.",

    "abstract": "Nearly all types of energy systems (such as power systems, natural gas supply\nsystems, fuel supply systems, and so forth) are going through a major\ntransition from centralised, top-down structures to distributed, clean energy\napproaches in order to address the concerns regarding climate change, air\nquality, depletion of natural resources, and energy security, whilst also\nenabling the supply of energy to communities in line with the goals of\nsustainable development. Accordingly, the establishment of the concept of\nsustainable, decentralised, multi-carrier energy systems, together with the\ndeclining costs of renewable energy technologies, has proposed changes in the\nenergy industry towards the development of integrated energy systems.\nNotwithstanding the potential benefits, the optimal capacity planning of these\nsystems with multiple energy carriers (such as electricity, heat, hydrogen, and\nbiogas) is exceedingly complex due to the concurrent goals and interrelated\nconstraints that must be satisfied, as well as the heavily context-dependent\nnature of such schemes. This paper puts forward an innovative optimal capacity\nplanning method for a cutting-edge, stand-alone multiple energy carrier\nmicro-grid (MECM) serving the electricity, hot water, and transportation fuel\ndemands of remote communities. The proposed MECM system is equipped with wind\nturbines, a hydrogen sub-system (including an electrolyser, a hydrogen\nreservoir, and a fuel cell), a hybrid super-capacitor/battery energy storage\nsystem, a hot water storage tank, a heat exchanger, an inline electric heater,\na hydrogen refuelling station, and some power converters. A numerical case\nstudy for the optimal capacity planning of the suggested MECM configuration, to\nbe realised on Stewart Island, New Zealand, is presented to evaluate the\neffectiveness of the proposed optimisation method.",

    "title": "Emission Reduction in Urban Environments by Replacing Conventional City Buses with Electric Bus Technology: A Case Study of Pakistan",
    "abstract": "The global transportation industry has become one of the main contributors to\nair pollution. Consequently, electric buses and green transportation are\ngaining popularity as crucial steps to reduce emission concerns. Many developed\ncountries have already adopted the concept of Battery Electric Buses (BEBs),\nwhile the developing ones are just starting with it. However, BEB fleets have\nadvantages, such as lower fuel, higher efficiency, lower maintenance, and\nenergy security. Yet, several obstacles must be overcome to support the mass\ndeployment of BEBs. These incorporate forthright expense charges, arranging\nloads, BEB reach, and newness to BEB innovation. Stakeholders like\npolicymakers, private company owners, and government leaders have a lot to\nconsider before introducing BEBs at any level in Pakistan. As a result, to\noperate an electric bus system profitably, it is crucial to develop a proper\nelectric bus network and fleet, especially for bus operators who need to buy\nenough electric buses at the appropriate time. As a result, this paper aims to\ninvestigate if operating an electric bus could be an alternative to regular bus\noperations. The proposed methodology develops modeling software to cater to\nvarious scenarios to determine a proper-designed electric bus operating system\nin terms of the electric bus route, service frequency, and quantity. This\nresearch work simulates and financially analyses an operating Public Transport\nInfrastructure with a proposed Green Solution. The results show that regardless\nof the high upfront costs of BEB infrastructure, it becomes profitable in 6-7\nyears, resulting in a decreased Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) of approximately\n30% of its counterpart. The study also provides a clear policy pathway to help\nstakeholders make informed decisions related to the electrification of public\ntransport in Pakistan.",

    "title": "Iron as a sustainable chemical carrier of renewable energy: Analysis of opportunities and challenges for retrofitting coal-fired power plants",
    "abstract": "As a result of the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26),\nseveral countries committed to phasing down coal electricity as soon as\npossible, deactivating hundreds of power plants in the near future. CO$_2$-free\nelectricity can be generated in these plants by retrofitting them for iron\ncombustion. Iron oxides produced during the process can be collected and\nreduced back to metallic iron using H$_2$, in a circular process where it\nbecomes an energy carrier. Using clean energy in the recycling process enables\nstorage and distribution of excess generated in periods of abundance. This\nconcept uses and scales up existing dry metal cycle technologies, which are the\nfocus of extensive research worldwide. Retrofitting is evaluated here to\ndetermine feasibility of adding these material requirements to markets, in the\ncontext of current plans for decarbonization of steel industry, and policies on\nhydrogen and renewable electricity. Results indicate that not only for a single\npower plant, but also on larger scales, the retrofitting plan is viable,\npromoting and supporting advancements in sustainable electricity, steel\nindustry and hydrogen production, converging necessary technological and\nconstruction efforts. The maturation and first commercial-scale application of\niron combustion technology by 2030, together with developing necessary\nreduction infrastructure over the next decades, would pave the way for\nlarge-scale retrofitting and support the phasing out of coal in many regions.\nThe proposed plan represents a feasible solution that takes advantage of\nexisting assets, creates a long-lasting legacy for the industry and establishes\ncircular energy economies that increase local energy security.",

In this paper, we enable the study and analysis of\nsecurity concerns by developing Transactive Energy Security Simulation Testbed\n(TESST), a TES testbed for simulating various cyber attacks. In this work, the\ntestbed is used for TES simulation with centralized clearing market,\nhighlighting weaknesses in a centralized system. Additionally, we present a\nblockchain enabled decentralized market solution supported by distributed\ncomputing for TES, which on one hand can alleviate some of the problems that we\nidentify, but on the other hand, may introduce newer issues. Future study of\nthese differing paradigms is necessary and will continue as we develop our\nsecurity simulation testbed.",

    "title": "Can occupant behaviors affect urban energy planning? Distributed stochastic optimization for energy communities",
    "abstract": "To meet carbon emission reduction goals in line with the Paris agreement,\nplanning resilient and sustainable energy systems has never been more\nimportant. In the building sector, particularly, strategic urban energy\nplanning engenders large optimization problems across multiple spatiotemporal\nscales leading to necessary system scope simplifications. This has resulted in\ndisconnected system scales, namely, building occupants and smart-city energy\nnetworks. This paper intends on bridging these disjointed scales to secure both\nresilient and more energy-efficient urban planning thanks to a holistic\napproach. The intent is to assess the aggregated impact of user behavior\nstochasticities on optimal urban energy planning. To this end, a stochastic\nenergy community sizing and operation problem is designed, encompassing\nmulti-level utilities founded on energy hub concepts for improved energy and\ncarbon emission efficiencies. To secure the scalability of our approach, an\norganic spatial problem distribution suitable for field deployment is put\nforth, validated by a proof of concept. Uncertainty factors affecting urban\nenergy planning are particularly examined through a local sensitivity analysis,\nnamely, economic, climate, and occupant-behavior uncertainties. Founded on\nhistorical measurements a typical Dutch energy community composed of 41\nresidential buildings is designed. Results disclose a fast-converging\ndistributed stochastic problem, where boilers are showcased as the preferred\nheating utility, and distributed renewable energy and storage systems were\nidentified as unprofitable for the community. Occupant behavior was\nparticularly exposed as the leading uncertainty factor impacting energy\ncommunity planning. This demonstrates the relevance and value of our approach\nin connecting occupants to cities for improved, and more resilient, urban\nenergy planning strategies.",

    "abstract": "In remote or islanded communities, the use of microgrids (MGs) is necessary\nto ensure electrification and resilience of supply. However, even in\nsmall-scale systems, it is computationally and mathematically challenging to\ndesign low-cost, optimal, sustainable solutions taking into consideration all\nthe uncertainties of load demands and power generations from renewable energy\nsources (RESs). This paper uses the open-source Python-based Energy Planning\n(PyEPLAN) tool, developed for the design of sustainable MGs in remote areas, on\nthe Alderney island, the 3$^{rd}$ largest of the Channel Islands with a\npopulation of about 2000 people. A two-stage stochastic model is used to\noptimally invest in battery storage, solar power, and wind power units.\nMoreover, the AC power flow equations are modelled by a linearised version of\nthe DistFlow model in PyEPLAN, where the investment variables are here-and-now\ndecisions and not a function of uncertain parameters while the operation\nvariables are wait-and-see decisions and a function of uncertain parameters.\nThe $k$-means clustering technique is used to generate a set of best\n(risk-seeker), nominal (risk-neutral), and worst (risk-averse) scenarios\ncapturing the uncertainty spectrum using the yearly historical patterns of load\ndemands and solar/wind power generations. The proposed investment planning tool\nis a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model and is coded with Pyomo in\nPyEPLAN.",

    "abstract": "The deployment of CO2 capture and storage (CCS) and negative emissions\ntechnologies (NETs) are crucial to meet the net-zero target by year 2050, as\nemphasised by the Glasgow Climate Pact. Over the years, several energy planning\nmodels have been developed to address the temporal aspects of carbon\nmanagement. However, limited works have incorporated CCS and NETs for bottom-up\nenergy planning at the individual plant scale, which is considered in this\nwork. The novel formulation is implemented in an open-source energy system\nsoftware that has been developed in this work for optimal decarbonisation\nplanning. The DECarbonation Options Optimisation (DECO2) software considers\nmultiperiod energy planning with a superstructural model and was developed in\nPython with an integrated user interface in Microsoft Excel. The software\napplication is demonstrated with two scenarios that differ in terms of the\navailabilities of mitigation technologies. Results demonstrated the potential\nof fuel substitutions for low-carbon alternatives in existing coal and natural\ngas power plants. Additionally, once NETs are mature and are available for\ncommercial deployment, their deployment is crucial in aiding CO2 removal in\nminimal investment costs scenarios. Overall, the newly developed open-source\nsoftware demonstrates the importance of determining the optimal deployment of\nmitigation technologies in meeting climate change targets for each period.",

A study on the impact\nof the replacement of 500KV AC transmission lines by VSC-HVDC transmission line\non system voltage security is conducted. The analysis is based on reactive load\nmargin method and implemented on one of the Dominion Energy planning models.\nDifferent control schemes of HVDC are considered.

    "title": "Stackelberg game-based optimal scheduling of integrated energy systems considering differences in heat demand across multi-functional areas",
    "abstract": "Demand-side management is very critical in China's energy systems because of\nits high fossil energy consumption and low system energy efficiency. A building\nshape factor is introduced in describing the architectural characteristics of\ndifferent functional areas, which are combined with the characteristics of the\nenergy consumed by users to investigate the features of heating load in\ndifferent functional areas. A Stackelberg game-based optimal scheduling model\nis proposed for electro-thermal integrated energy systems, which seeks to\nmaximize the revenue of integrated energy operator (IEO) and minimize the cost\nof users. Here, IEO and users are the Stackelberg game leader and followers,\nrespectively. The leader uses real-time energy prices to guide loads to\nparticipate in demand response, while the followers make energy plans based on\nprice feedback. Using the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) condition and the big-M\nmethod, the model is transformed into a mixed-integer quadratic programming\n(MIQP) problem, which is solved by using MATLAB and CPLEX software. The results\ndemonstrate that the proposal manages to balance the interests of IEO and\nusers. Furthermore, the heating loads of public and residential areas can be\nmanaged separately based on the differences in energy consumption and building\nshape characteristics, thereby improving the system operational flexibility and\npromoting renewable energy consumption.",

    "title": "Community Time-Activity Trajectory Modelling based on Markov Chain Simulation and Dirichlet Regression",
    "abstract": "Accurate modeling of human time-activity trajectory is essential to support\ncommunity resilience and emergency response strategies such as daily energy\nplanning and urban seismic vulnerability assessment. However, existing modeling\nof time-activity trajectory is only driven by socio-demographic information\nwith identical activity trajectories shared among the same group of people and\nneglects the influence of the environment. To further improve human\ntime-activity trajectory modeling, this paper constructs community\ntime-activity trajectory and analyzes how social-demographic and built\nenvironment influence people s activity trajectory based on Markov Chains and\nDirichlet Regression. We use the New York area as a case study and gather data\nfrom American Time Use Survey, Policy Map, and the New York City Energy & Water\nPerformance Map to evaluate the proposed method. To validate the regression\nmodel, Box s M Test and T-test are performed with 80% data training the model\nand the left 20% as the test sample. The modeling results align well with the\nactual human behavior trajectories, demonstrating the effectiveness of the\nproposed method. It also shows that both social-demographic and built\nenvironment factors will significantly impact a community's time-activity\ntrajectory. Specifically, 1) Diversity and median age both have a significant\ninfluence on the proportion of time people assign to education activity. 2)\nTransportation condition affects people s activity trajectory in the way that\nlonger commute time decreases the proportion of biological activity (eg.\nsleeping and eating) and increases people s working time. 3) Residential\ndensity affects almost all activities with a significant p-value for all\nbiological needs, household management, working, education, and personal\npreference.",

    "abstract": "Multi-sector capacity expansion models play a crucial role in energy planning\nby providing decision support for policymaking in technology development. To\nensure reliable support, these models require high technological, spatial, and\ntemporal resolution, leading to large-scale linear programming problems that\nare often computationally intractable. To address this challenge, conventional\napproaches rely on simplifying abstractions that trade accuracy for\ncomputational efficiency. Benders decomposition has been widely explored to\nimprove computational efficiency in electricity capacity expansion models.\nSpecifically, state-of-the-art methods have primarily focused on improving\nperformance through temporal decomposition. However, multi-sector models\nintroduce additional complexity, requiring new decomposition strategies. In\nthis work, we propose a budget-based formulation to extend decomposition to the\nsectoral and spatial domains. We test the developed sectoral and spatial\nBenders decomposition algorithms on case studies of the continental United\nStates, considering different configurations in terms of spatial and temporal\nresolution. Results show that our algorithms achieve substantial performance\nimprovement compared to existing decomposition algorithms, with runtime\nreductions within 15%-70%. The proposed methods leverage the generic structure\nof multi-sector capacity expansion models, and can thus be applied to most\nexisting energy planning models, ensuring computational tractability without\nsacrificing resolution.",

In addition, using the idea of model\npredictive control (MPC), we design the {PXA-MPC}, which is an online\nimplementation of the PXA. Compared to other empirical phase balancing\nstrategies, the PXA algorithm significantly improves the charging performance\nby maximizing energy delivery, minimizing charging price, and assisting future\nenergy planning.

This article presents a contemporary review\nof recent breakthroughs on the utilization, redistribution, trading and\nplanning of energy harvested in future wireless networks interoperating with\nsmart grids. This article starts with classical models of renewable energy\nharvesting technologies. We embark on constrained operation and optimization of\ndifferent energy harvesting wireless systems, such as point-to-point,\nmultipoint-to-point, multipoint-to-multipoint, multi-hop, and multi-cell\nsystems. We also review wireless power and information transfer technologies\nwhich provide a special implementation of energy harvesting wireless\ncommunications. A significant part of the article is devoted to the\nredistribution of redundant (unused) energy harvested within cellular networks,\nthe energy planning under dynamic pricing when smart grids are in place, and\ntwo-way energy trading between cellular networks and smart grids. Applications\nof different optimization tools, such as convex optimization, Lagrangian\ndual-based method, subgradient method, and Lyapunov-based online optimization,\nare compared. This article also collates the potential applications of energy\nharvesting techniques in emerging (or upcoming) 5G/B5G communication systems.\nIt is revealed that an effective redistribution and two-way trading of energy\ncan significantly reduce the electricity bills of wireless service providers\nand decrease the consumption of brown energy.

    "abstract": "Simulating energy systems is vital for energy planning to understand the\neffects of fluctuating renewable energy sources and integration of multiple\nenergy sectors. Capacity expansion is a powerful tool for energy analysts and\nconsists of simulating energy systems with the option of investing in new\nenergy sources. In this paper, we apply clustering based aggregation techniques\nfrom the literature to very different real-life sector coupled energy systems.\nWe systematically compare the aggregation techniques with respect to solution\nquality and simulation time. Furthermore, we propose two new clustering\napproaches with promising results. We show that the aggregation techniques\nresult in consistent solution time savings between 75% and 90%. Also, the\nquality of the aggregated solutions is generally very good. To the best of our\nknowledge, we are the first to analyze and conclude that a weighted\nrepresentation of clusters is beneficial. Furthermore, to the best of our\nknowledge, we are the first to recommend a clustering technique with good\nperformance across very different energy systems: the k-means with Euclidean\ndistance measure, clustering days and with weighted selection, where the\nmedian, maximum and minimum elements from clusters are selected. A deeper\nanalysis of the results reveal that the aggregation techniques excel when the\ninvestment decisions correlate well with the overall behavior of the energy\nsystem.

The structures of these\nconstraint representations are exploited within a mixed-integer quadratic\nprogram solver tailored to MPC motion planning problems. Results apply the\nproposed methodology to coupled motion and energy utilization planning problems\nfor 1) a hybrid-electric vehicle that must restrict engine usage when flying\nover regions with noise restrictions, and 2) an electric package delivery drone\nthat must track waysets with both position and battery state of charge\nrequirements.

    "abstract": "The residential buildings sector is one of the largest electricity consumers\nworldwide and contributes disproportionally to peak electricity demand in many\nregions. Strongly driven by occupant activities at home, household energy\nconsumption is stochastic and heterogeneous in nature. However, most\nresidential building energy models applied by industry use homogeneous,\ndeterministic occupant activity schedules, which work well for predictions of\nannual energy consumption, but can result in unrealistic hourly or sub-hourly\nelectric load profiles, with exaggerated or muted peaks. This mattered less in\nthe past, but the increasing proportion of variable renewable energy generators\nin power systems means that representing the heterogeneity and stochasticity of\noccupant behavior is crucial for reliable energy planning. This is particularly\ntrue for systems that include distributed energy resources, such as\ngrid-interactive efficient buildings, solar photovoltaics, and battery storage.\nThis work presents a stochastic occupant behavior simulator that models the\nenergy use behavior of individual household members. It also presents an\nintegration with a building stock model to simulate residential building loads\nmore accurately at community, city, state, and national scales. More\nspecifically, we first employ clustering techniques to identify distinct\npatterns of occupant behavior. Then, we combine time-inhomogeneous Markov chain\nsimulations with probabilistic sampling of event durations to realistically\nsimulate occupant behaviors. This stochastic simulator is integrated with\nResStock, a large-scale residential building stock simulation tool, to\ndemonstrate the capability of stochastic residential building load modeling at\nscale. The simulation results were validated against both American Time Use\nSurvey data and measured end-use electricity data for accuracy and reliability.",

    "abstract": "Macro-energy system modelling is used by decision-makers to steer the global\nenergy transition toward an affordable, sustainable and reliable future.\nClosed-source models are the current standard for most policy and industry\ndecisions. However, open models have proven to be competitive alternatives that\npromote science, robust technical analysis, collaboration and transparent\npolicy decision-making. Yet, two issues slow the adoption: open models are\noften designed with limited geographic scope, hindering synergies from\ncollaboration, or are based on low spatially resolved data, limiting their use.\nHere we introduce PyPSA-Earth, the first open-source global energy system model\nwith data in high spatial and temporal resolution. It enables large-scale\ncollaboration by providing a tool that can model the world energy system or any\nsubset of it. This work is derived from the European PyPSA-Eur model using new\ndata and functions. It is suitable for operational as well as combined\ngeneration, storage and transmission expansion studies. The model provides two\nmain features: (1) customizable data extraction and preparation scripts with\nglobal coverage and (2) a PyPSA energy modelling framework integration. The\ndata includes electricity demand, generation and medium to high-voltage\nnetworks from open sources, yet additional data can be further integrated. A\nbroad range of clustering and grid meshing strategies help adapt the model to\ncomputational and practical needs. A data validation for the entire African\ncontinent is performed and the optimization features are tested with a 2060\nnet-zero planning study for Nigeria. The demonstration shows that the presented\ndevelopments can build a highly detailed energy system model for energy\nplanning studies to support policy and technical decision-making.

    "abstract": "Facing economic challenges due to the diverse objectives of businesses, and\nconsumers, commercial greenhouses strive to minimize energy costs while\naddressing CO2 emissions. This scenario is intensified by rising energy costs\nand the global imperative to curtail CO2 emissions. To address these dynamic\neconomic challenges, this paper proposes an architectural design for an energy\neconomic dispatch testbed for commercial greenhouses. Utilizing the\nAttribute-Driven De-sign method, core architectural components of a\nsoftware-in-the-loop testbed are proposed which emphasizes modularity and\ncareful consideration of the multi-objective optimization problem. This\napproach extends prior research by implementing a modular multi-objective\noptimization framework in Java. The results demonstrate the successful\nintegration of the CO2 reduction objective within the modular architecture with\nminimal effort. The multi-objective optimization output can also be employed to\nexamine cost and CO2 objectives, ultimately serving as a valuable\ndecision-support tool. The novel testbed architecture and a modular approach\ncan tackle the multi-objective optimization problem and enable commercial\ngreenhouses to navigate the intricate landscape of energy cost and CO2\nemissions management.",

    "title": "On the Impact of Smartification Strategies for the State Estimation of Low Voltage Grids",
    "abstract": "The decarbonization of for example the energy or heat sector leads to the\ntransformation of distribution grids. The expansion of decentralized energy\nresources and the integration of new consumers due to sector coupling (e.g.\nheat pumps or electric vehicles) into low voltage grids increases the need for\ngrid expansion and usage of flexibilities in the grid. A high observability of\nthe current grid status is needed to perform these tasks efficiently and\neffectively. Therefore, there is a need to increase the observability of low\nvoltage grids by installing measurement technologies (e.g. smart meters).\nMultiple different measurement technologies are available for low voltage grids\nwhich can vary in their benefit to observation quality and their installation\ncosts. Therefore, Bayernwerk Netz GmbH and E.DIS AG in cooperation with\nE-Bridge Consulting GmbH and the Institute for High Voltage Equipment and\nGrids, Digitalization and Energy Economics (IAEW) investigated the\neffectiveness of different strategies for the smartification of low voltage\ngrids. This paper presents the methodology used for the investigation and\nexemplary results focusing on the impact of intelligent cable distribution\ncabinets and smart meters on the quality of the state estimation.",

    "abstract": "The transition to renewable energy is driving the rise of distributed\nmulti-energy systems, in which individual energy hubs and prosumers (e.g.,\nhomes, industrial campuses) generate, store, and trade energy. Economic Model\nPredictive Control (MPC) schemes are widely used to optimize operation of\nenergy hubs by efficiently dispatching resources and minimizing costs while\nensuring operational constraints are met. Peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading\namong hubs enhances network efficiency and reduces costs but also increases\ncomputational and privacy challenges, especially as the network scales.\nAdditionally, current distributed control techniques require global\nrecomputation whenever the network topology changes, limiting scalability. To\naddress these challenges, we propose a clustering-based P2P trading framework\nthat enables plug-and-play operation, allowing energy hubs to seamlessly join\nor leave without requiring network-wide controller updates. The impact is\nrestricted to the hubs within the affected cluster. The energy trading problem\nis formulated as a bi-level bargaining game, where inter-cluster trading\ncommitments are determined at the cluster level, while energy dispatch and\ncost-sharing among hubs within a cluster are refined at the hub level. Both\nlevels are solved in a distributed manner using ADMM, ensuring computational\nfeasibility and privacy preservation. Moreover, we develop plug-and-play\nprocedures to handle dynamic topology changes at both the hub and cluster\nlevels, minimizing disruptions across the network. Simulation results\ndemonstrate that the proposed bi-level framework reduces operational costs, and\nenables scalable energy management under plug-and-play operation.",

    "abstract": "Agrivoltaics (AV) is a dual land-use approach to collocate solar energy\ngeneration with agriculture for preserving the terrestrial ecosystem and\nenabling food-energy-water synergies. Here, we present a systematic approach to\nmodel the economic performance of AV relative to standalone ground-mounted PV\n(GMPV) and explore how the module design configuration can affect the dual\nfood-energy economic performance. A remarkably simple criterion for economic\nfeasibility is quantified that relates the land preservation cost to dual\nfood-energy profit. We explore case studies including both high and low value\ncrops under fixed tilt bifacial modules oriented either along the conventional\nNorth/South (N/S) facings or vertical East/West (E/W) facings. For each module\nconfiguration, the array density is varied to explore an economically feasible\ndesign space relative to GMPV for a range of module to land cost ratio (M_L) -\na location-specific indicator relating the module technology (hardware and\ninstallation) costs to the soft (land acquisition, tax, overheads, etc.) costs.\nTo offset a typically higher AV module cost needed to preserve the cropland,\nboth E/W and N/S orientated modules favor high value crops, reduced (<60%)\nmodule density, and higher M_L (>25). In contrast, higher module density and an\nincreased feed-in-tariff (FIT) relative to GMPV are desirable at lower M_L. The\neconomic trends vary sharply for M_L< 10 but tend to saturate for M_L> 20. For\nlow value crops, ~15% additional FIT can enable economic equivalence to GMPV at\nstandard module density. The proposed modeling framework can provide a valuable\ntool for AV stakeholders to assess, predict, and optimize the techno-economic\ndesign for AV",

We show that\nincreasing the degree of cooperativity induces a qualitative transition from a\nsegregated phase of low utility towards a mixed phase of high utility.

    "abstract": "The national space programs have an historic opportunity to help solve the\nglobal-scale economic and environmental problems of Earth while becoming more\neffective at science through the use of space resources. Space programs will be\nmore cost-effective when they work to establish a supply chain in space, mining\nand manufacturing then replicating the assets of the supply chain so it grows\nto larger capacity. This has become achievable because of advances in robotics\nand artificial intelligence. It is roughly estimated that developing a lunar\noutpost that relies upon and also develops the supply chain will cost about 1/3\nor less of the existing annual budgets of the national space programs. It will\nrequire a sustained commitment of several decades to complete, during which\ntime science and exploration become increasingly effective. At the end, this\nspace industry will capable of addressing global-scale challenges including\nlimited resources, clean energy, economic development, and preservation of the\nenvironment. Other potential solutions, including nuclear fusion and\nterrestrial renewable energy sources, do not address the root problem of our\nlimited globe and there are real questions whether they will be inadequate or\ntoo late. While industry in space likewise cannot provide perfect assurance, it\nis uniquely able to solve the root problem, and it gives us an important chance\nthat we should grasp. What makes this such an historic opportunity is that the\nspace-based solution is obtainable as a side-benefit of doing space science and\nexploration within their existing budgets. Thinking pragmatically, it may take\nsome time for policymakers to agree that setting up a complete supply chain is\nan achievable goal, so this paper describes a strategy of incremental progress.",

    "title": "Energy Consumption Modeling for DED-based Hybrid Additive Manufacturing",
    "abstract": "The awareness of energy consumption is gaining much more attention in\nmanufacturing due to its economic and sustainability benefits. An energy\nconsumption model is needed for quantifying the consumption and predicting the\nimpact of various process parameters in manufacturing. This paper aims to\ndevelop an energy consumption model for Direct Energy Deposition (DED) based\nHybrid Additive Manufacturing (HAM) for an Inconel 718 part. The Specific\nEnergy Consumption (SEC) is used while developing the energy consumption of the\nproduct manufacturing lifecycle. This study focuses on the analysis to\ninvestigate three significant factors (scanning speed, laser power, and feed\nrate), their interactions' effects, and whether they have a significant\neffect.in energy consumption. The results suggest that all the factors have a\nstrong influence, but their interaction effects have a weak influence on the\nenergy consumption for HAM. Among the three process parameters, it is found\nthat laser power has the most significant effect on energy consumption. Again,\nbased on the regression analysis, this study also recommends high scanning\nspeed while the laser power and feed rate should be low. Also, idle time has\nsignificant energy consumption during the whole HAM process.",

    "abstract": "At present, there is a growing demand for drones with diverse capabilities\nthat can be used in both civilian and military applications, and this topic is\nreceiving increasing attention. When it comes to drone operations, the amount\nof energy they consume is a determining factor in their ability to achieve\ntheir full potential. According to this, it appears that it is necessary to\nidentify the factors affecting the energy consumption of the unmanned air\nvehicle (UAV) during the mission process, as well as examine the general\nfactors that influence the consumption of energy. This chapter aims to provide\nan overview of the current state of research in the area of UAV energy\nconsumption and provide general categorizations of factors affecting UAV's\nenergy consumption as well as an investigation of different energy models.",

A competent\nanalytics method will be highly advantageous to provide the correct direction\nof energy saving for an industry.

The\nresult shows that energy utilization is dependent on the time of operation of\nthe equipments in the plant. Energy sparing obtained via technical innovation\nin unit process maybe misplaced due to the expanding time of operation within\nthe plant. Energy loss and the distribution of energy loss in the camplate\nproduction plant were analysed and the probable energy saving methods were\nidentified from the results.",

However, real-world driving\nincludes longitudinal as well as lateral motion. Therefore, it is important to\nunderstand the effects of lateral dynamics on battery energy consumption. This\npaper conducts an analysis of the stated effect and validates its significance\nthrough simulations. Specifically, this study demonstrates that inclusion of\nthe effect of lateral dynamics can improve accuracy and reliability of\nsolutions in eco-routing, eco-driving and range prediction applications.",

    "abstract": "Waste heat production represents an inevitable consequence of energy\nconversion as per the laws of thermodynamics. Based on this fact, by using\nsimple theoretical models, we analyze constraints on the habitability of\nEarth-like terrestrial planets hosting putative technological species and\ntechnospheres characterized by persistent exponential growth of energy\nconsumption and waste heat generation. In particular, we quantify the\ndeleterious effects of rising surface temperature on biospheric processes and\nthe eventual loss of liquid water. Irrespective of whether these sources of\nenergy are ultimately stellar or planetary (e.g., nuclear, fossil fuels) in\nnature, we demonstrate that the loss of habitable conditions on such\nterrestrial planets may be expected to occur on timescales of $\\lesssim 1000$\nyears, as measured from the start of the exponential phase, provided that the\nannual growth rate of energy consumption is of order $1\\%$. We conclude with a\ndiscussion of the types of evolutionary trajectories that might be feasible for\nindustrialized technological species, and we sketch the ensuing implications\nfor technosignature searches.",

    "abstract": "Energy consumption in robotic arms is a significant concern in industrial\nautomation due to rising operational costs and environmental impact. This study\ninvestigates the use of a local reduction method to optimize energy efficiency\nin robotic systems without compromising performance. The approach refines\nmovement parameters, minimizing energy use while maintaining precision and\noperational reliability. A three-joint robotic arm model was tested using\nsimulation over a 30-second period for various tasks, including pick-and-place\nand trajectory-following operations. The results revealed that the local\nreduction method reduced energy consumption by up to 25% compared to\ntraditional techniques such as Model Predictive Control (MPC) and Genetic\nAlgorithms (GA). Unlike MPC, which requires significant computational\nresources, and GA, which has slow convergence rates, the local reduction method\ndemonstrated superior adaptability and computational efficiency in real-time\napplications. The study highlights the scalability and simplicity of the local\nreduction approach, making it an attractive option for industries seeking\nsustainable and cost-effective solutions. Additionally, this method can\nintegrate seamlessly with emerging technologies like Artificial Intelligence\n(AI), further enhancing its application in dynamic and complex environments.\nThis research underscores the potential of the local reduction method as a\npractical tool for optimizing robotic arm operations, reducing energy demands,\nand contributing to sustainability in industrial automation. Future work will\nfocus on extending the approach to real-world scenarios and incorporating\nAI-driven adjustments for more dynamic adaptability.",

    "abstract": "The current formulation of the optimal scheduling of appliance energy\nconsumption uses as optimization variables the vectors of appliances' scheduled\nenergy consumption over equally-divided time slots of a day, which does not\ntake into account the atomicity of appliances' operations (i.e., the\nunsplittable nature of appliances' operations and resulting energy\nconsumption). In this paper, we provide a new formulation of atomic scheduling\nof energy consumption based on the optimal routing framework; the flow\nconfigurations of users over multiple paths between the common source and\ndestination nodes of a ring network are used as optimization variables, which\nindicate the starting times of scheduled energy consumption, and optimal\nscheduling problems are now formulated in terms of the user flow\nconfigurations. Because the atomic optimal scheduling results in a\nBoolean-convex problem for a convex objective function, we propose a successive\nconvex relaxation technique for efficient calculation of an approximate\nsolution, where we iteratively drop fractional-valued elements and apply convex\nrelaxation to the resulting problem until we find a feasible suboptimal\nsolution. Numerical results for the cost and peak-to-average ratio minimization\nproblems demonstrate that the successive convex relaxation technique can\nprovide solutions close to, often identical to, global optimal solutions.",

The successful adoption of EVs heavily depends on energy\nconsumption models that can accurately and reliably estimate electricity\nconsumption. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art of EV energy consumption\nmodels, aiming to provide guidance for future development of EV applications.\nWe summarize influential variables of EV energy consumption into four\ncategories: vehicle component, vehicle dynamics, traffic and environment\nrelated factors. We classify and discuss EV energy consumption models in terms\nof modeling scale (microscopic vs. macroscopic) and methodology (data-driven\nvs. rule-based). Our review shows trends of increasing macroscopic models that\ncan be used to estimate trip-level EV energy consumption and increasing\ndata-driven models that utilized machine learning technologies to estimate EV\nenergy consumption based on large volume real-world data. We identify research\ngaps for EV energy consumption models, including the development of energy\nestimation models for modes other than personal vehicles (e.g., electric buses,\nelectric trucks, and electric non-road vehicles); the development of energy\nestimation models that are suitable for applications related to vehicle-to-grid\nintegration; and the development of multi-scale energy estimation models as a\nholistic modeling approach.",

As there are\nvery few electric vehicle (EV) charging stations, EV trip energy consumption\nestimation can make EV routing and charging planning easier for drivers. In\nthis research article, we propose a new driver behaviour-centric EV energy\nconsumption estimation model using probabilistic neural networks with model\nuncertainty. By incorporating model uncertainty into neural networks, we have\ncreated an ensemble of neural networks using Monte Carlo approximation. Our\nmethod comprehensively considers various vehicle dynamics, driver behaviour and\nenvironmental factors to estimate EV energy consumption for a given trip. We\npropose relative positive acceleration (RPA), average acceleration and average\ndeceleration as driver behaviour factors in EV energy consumption estimation\nand this paper shows that the use of these driver behaviour features improves\nthe accuracy of the EV energy consumption model significantly. Instead of\npredicting a single-point estimate for EV trip energy consumption, this\nproposed method predicts a probability distribution for the EV trip energy\nconsumption. The experimental results of our approach show that our proposed\nprobabilistic neural network with weight uncertainty achieves a mean absolute\npercentage error of 9.3% and outperforms other existing EV energy consumption\nmodels in terms of accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Capacitive Deionization (CDI) is a non-energy intensive water treatment\ntechnology. To harness the enormous potential of CDI requires improving\nperformance, while offering industrially feasible solutions. Following this\nidea, the replacement of costly metallic components has been proposed as a mean\nof limiting corrosion problems. This work explores the use of nanostructured\nhybrid networks to enable free-form and metal-free CDI devices. The strategy\nconsists of producing interpenetrated networks of highly conductive flexible\ncarbon nanotube (CNT) fibre fabrics and nanostructured metal oxides,\n{\\gamma}Al2O3 and TiO2, through ultrasound-assisted nanoparticle infiltration\nand sintering. In the resulting hybrids, a uniform distribution of porous metal\noxide is firmly attached to the nanocarbon network while the flexibility, high\nconductivity and low-dimensional properties of the CNTs are preserved. These\nelectrodes present a high porosity ($105 - 118 m^{2} g^{1}$), notably low\nelectrical ($< 0,1 k \\Omega cm^{2}$) and low charge transfer resistance (4\n{\\Omega}), thus enabling the infiltration of aqueous electrolytes and serving\nas current collector. In this work we built a large asymmetrical cylindrical\nCDI device solely made of these electrodes and conventional plastics. The cell\nprovides, high average salt adsorption rates of $1.16 mg /g_{AM} min$ ($0.23\nmg/g_{CDIunit} min$, low energy consumption ($0.18 Wh/g_{salt}$) and stable\nelectrochemical performance above 50 cycles for brackish water desalination.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we consider energy demand prediction in district heating\nsystems. Effective energy demand prediction is essential in combined heat power\nsystems when offering electrical energy in competitive electricity markets. To\naddress this problem, we propose two sets of algorithms: (1) a novel extension\nto the algorithm proposed by E. Dotzauer and (2) an autoregressive predictor\nbased on hour-of-week adjusted linear regression on moving averages of energy\nconsumption. These two methods are compared against state-of-the-art artificial\nneural networks. Energy demand predictor algorithms have various computational\ncosts and prediction quality. While prediction quality is a widely used measure\nof predictor superiority, computational costs are less frequently analyzed and\ntheir impact is not so extensively studied. When predictor algorithms are\nconstantly updated using new data, some computationally expensive forecasting\nmethods may become inapplicable. The computational costs can be split into\ntraining and execution parts. The execution part is the cost paid when the\nalready trained algorithm is applied to predict something. In this paper, we\nevaluate the above methods with respect to the quality and computational costs,\nboth in the training and in the execution. The comparison is conducted on a\nreal-world dataset from a district heating system in the northwest part of\nPoland.",

    "title": "A Resource Allocation Scheme for Energy Demand Management in 6G-enabled Smart Grid",
    "abstract": "Smart grid (SG) systems enhance grid resilience and efficient operation,\nleveraging the bidirectional flow of energy and information between generation\nfacilities and prosumers. For energy demand management (EDM), the SG network\nrequires computing a large amount of data generated by massive\nInternet-of-things sensors and advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) with\nminimal latency. This paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based\nresource allocation scheme in a 6G-enabled SG edge network to offload\nresource-consuming EDM computation to edge servers. Automatic resource\nprovisioning is achieved by harnessing the computational capabilities of smart\nmeters in the dynamic edge network. To enforce DRL-assisted policies in dense\n6G networks, the state information from multiple edge servers is required.\nHowever, adversaries can \"poison\" such information through false state\ninjection (FSI) attacks, exhausting SG edge computing resources. Toward\naddressing this issue, we investigate the impact of such FSI attacks with\nrespect to abusive utilization of edge resources, and develop a lightweight FSI\ndetection mechanism based on supervised classifiers. Simulation results\ndemonstrate the efficacy of DRL in dynamic resource allocation, the impact of\nthe FSI attacks, and the effectiveness of the detection technique.",

    "abstract": "Smart energy networks provide for an effective means to accommodate high\npenetrations of variable renewable energy sources like solar and wind, which\nare key for deep decarbonisation of energy production. However, given the\nvariability of the renewables as well as the energy demand, it is imperative to\ndevelop effective control and energy storage schemes to manage the variable\nenergy generation and achieve desired system economics and environmental goals.\nIn this paper, we introduce a hybrid energy storage system composed of battery\nand hydrogen energy storage to handle the uncertainties related to electricity\nprices, renewable energy production and consumption. We aim to improve\nrenewable energy utilisation and minimise energy costs and carbon emissions\nwhile ensuring energy reliability and stability within the network. To achieve\nthis, we propose a multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient approach,\nwhich is a deep reinforcement learning-based control strategy to optimise the\nscheduling of the hybrid energy storage system and energy demand in real-time.\nThe proposed approach is model-free and does not require explicit knowledge and\nrigorous mathematical models of the smart energy network environment.\nSimulation results based on real-world data show that: (i) integration and\noptimised operation of the hybrid energy storage system and energy demand\nreduces carbon emissions by 78.69%, improves cost savings by 23.5% and\nrenewable energy utilisation by over 13.2% compared to other baseline models\nand (ii) the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art self-learning\nalgorithms like deep-Q network.",

Space heating is highly dependent on ambient\nconditions and susceptible to climate change. We adopt a techno-economic\nstandpoint and assess the impact of climate change on decentralised heating\ndemand and the cost-optimal mix of heat pump and gas boiler technologies.\nTemperature data with high spatial resolution from nine climate models\nimplementing three Representative Concentration Pathways from IPCC are used to\nestimate climate induced changes in the European demand side for heating.

We find that space heating demand decreases by about 16%, 24% and\n42% in low, intermediate and extreme global warming scenarios.

    "abstract": "In this chapter, we report on our experience with domestic flexible electric\nenergy demand based on a regular commercial (HVAC)-based heating system in a\nhouse. Our focus is on investigating the predictability of the energy demand of\nthe heating system and of the thermal response when varying the heating system\nsettings. Being able to form such predictions is crucial for most flexible\ndemand algorithms. We will compare several methods for predicting the thermal\nand energy response, which either gave good results or which are currently\npromoted in the literature for controlling buildings. We will report that the\nstochasticity of a house response is -- in our experience -- the main\ndifficulty in providing domestic flexible demand from heating. The experiments\nwere carried out on a regular house in Norway, equipped with four air-to-air\nMitsubishi heat pumps and a high-efficiency balanced ventilation system. The\nhouse was equipped with multiple IoT-based climate sensors, real-time power\nmeasurement, and the possibility to drive the HVAC system via the IoT. The\nhouse is operating on the spot market (Nord Pool NO3) and is exposed to a peak\nenergy demand penalty. Over a period of three years, we have collected data on\nthe house (temperatures, humidity, air quality), real-time power and hourly\nenergy consumption, while applying various flexible demand algorithms\nresponding to the local energy costs. This has produced large variations in the\nsettings of the heating system and energy demand, resulting in rich data for\ninvestigating the house response. This chapter aims at providing important\ninsights on providing flexible demand from houses in cold climates.",

    "abstract": "From 1972 and the Meadows report to 1997 and the ratification of the Kyoto\nProtocol by most of the countries in the world, the global energy policy\nframework has undergone a paradigm shift, as human societies have been leaving\naside the sole economic growth to embrace the broader concept of sustainable\ndevelopment. As new electrification vectors, modern renewable power systems,\nsuch as solar PV, have sprung up in the wake of this major mutation and have\ntypically been following an exponential growth since the mid-nineties.\nElectricity as well as its lack indeed holds a central position within the\nhuman development apparatus, from highly interconnected centralized power\nnetworks reaching 100 % of the population in developed countries, to the almost\n500 millions people without access to electricity in the multidimensionally\npoor rural areas of Sub-Saharan Africa. The encounter of the worldwide energy\ncontext being changed with each of these specific social-energy paradigms has\nended up considering two strategies for integrating renewable resources in\npower systems: the grid-connected architecture for meeting the sustainable\ndevelopment requirements, and the rural off-grid electrification for settling\nthe lack of human development. By means of a historical and cross-sectional\noverview, we depict here the ins and outs of this protean pattern and, using\nthe case of solar PV, analyze how it has eventually affected the development\nand sustainability of renewable power systems in Sub-Saharan Africa.",

    "abstract": "Multi criteria decision analysis (MCDA) has been used to provide a holistic\nevaluation of the quality of 13 electricity generation technologies in use\ntoday. A group of 19 energy experts cast scores on a scale of 1 to 10 using 12\nquality criteria, based around the pillars of sustainability (society,\nenvironment and economy), with the aim of quantifying each criterion for each\ntechnology. The total mean score is employed as a holistic measure of system\nquality. The top three technologies to emerge in rank order are nuclear,\ncombined cycle gas and hydroelectric. The bottom three are solar PV, biomass\nand tidal lagoon. All seven new renewable technologies fared badly, perceived\nto be expensive, unreliable, and not as environmentally friendly as is often\nassumed. We validate our approach by 1) comparing scores for pairs of criteria\nwhere we expect a correlation to exist; 2) comparing our qualitative scores\nwith quantitative data; and; 3) comparing our qualitative scores with NEEDS\nproject baseline costs. In many cases, R2>0.8 suggests that the structured\nhierarchy of our approach has led to scores that may be used in a\nsemi-quantitative way. Adopting the results of this survey would lead to a very\ndifferent set of energy policy priorities in the OECD and throughout the world.",

    "abstract": "Minimizing both power fluctuations and energy waste in an electrical grid is\na central challenge to energy policy. Any discrepancy between power production\nand loads may lead to inefficiencies and instability in the system. Right now,\nthe electrical grid is an analog system that only retroactively reacts to power\ndemands. The balancing act becomes even harder with the penetration of\nsustainable resources (e.g., wind turbines). Here, we consider the effect of\nrandom perturbations to the grid's steady states operation. A model is\nconstructed and analyzed within the framework of a randomly perturbed Markovian\nchain. Instead of balancing continuous values for supply and demand, the model\nassumes that both the generators and the users adhere to discrete pattern\nenergy levels which is supplemented by local, short-term energy storage units\n(STESU). Under reasonable assumptions, we show that this grid maintains\nstability (meaning, a constant difference between supply and demand) over long\nperiods of time while subjected to randomly fluctuating energy conditions.",

    "title": "Can models for long-term decarbonization policies guarantee security of power supply? A perspective from gas and power sector coupling",
    "abstract": "The assessment of adequacy and security of the energy system requires the\ndetailed knowledge of physical and operational characteristics. In contrast,\nstudies concerning energy transitions employ stylized models that oftentimes\nignore the technical properties but have a lasting influence on long-term\nenergy policies. This paper investigates the gap between energy system planning\nand operational models by linking these two perspectives: (1) a long-term\ninvestment model with low spatial resolution and high level of aggregation, and\n(2) a spatially resolved system security model that captures the\ninterdependences between the backbone of the electric power sector, i.e., the\nelectricity and the gas infrastructures. We assess EU decarbonization pathways\nof the electricity sector towards 2050 by integrating the investment decisions\nof the long-term planning model and the safety performance of the resulting\nsystem operations via the security assessment model. In a large RES deployment\nscenario, we investigate two flexibility options: gas power plants and\ncross-country transmission expansion. Using the integrated model, we analyze\nhow the adequacy and security of supply under extreme short-term operational\nconditions impact the long-term planning of the energy system and the\ninvestment decision-making. We provide country specific recommendations for UK.\nResults indicate weaknesses in the gas-electricity system and suggest\nimprovements on capacity allocation.",

    "abstract": "Locational marginal emissions rates (LMEs) estimate the rate of change in\nemissions due to a small change in demand in a transmission network, and are an\nimportant metric for assessing the impact of various energy policies or\ninterventions. In this work, we develop a new method for computing the LMEs of\nan electricity system via implicit differentiation. The method is model\nagnostic; it can compute LMEs for any convex optimization-based dispatch model,\nincluding some of the complex dispatch models employed by system operators in\nreal electricity systems. In particular, this method lets us derive LMEs for\ndynamic dispatch models, i.e., models with temporal constraints such as ramping\nand storage. Using real data from the U.S. electricity system, we validate the\nproposed method against a state-of-the-art merit-order-based method and show\nthat incorporating dynamic constraints improves model accuracy by 8.2%.\nFinally, we use simulations on a realistic 240-bus model of WECC to demonstrate\nthe flexibility of the tool and the importance of incorporating dynamic\nconstraints. Namely, static LMEs and dynamic LMEs exhibit a normalized average\nRMS deviation of 28.40%, implying dynamic constraints are essential to\naccurately modeling emissions rates.",

    "abstract": "This study sets out to analyze future synergies between the O&G and\nrenewables sectors and explore how exploiting these synergies could lead to\neconomic and environmental benefits. By firstly reviewing and highlighting\nrelevant technologies and related projects, this report synthesizes the state\nof the art in offshore energy system integration, by focusing on three key\ntechnologies in electrification/floating wind, electrolysis/hydrogen production\nand Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). With a timeframe out to 2050 and model\nscope including all North Sea neighbouring countries, this analysis explores a\ntotal of nine future scenarios for the North Sea energy system. The main\nresults include an immediate electrification of all operational DUC platforms\nby linking them to the shore and/or a planned Danish energy island. These\nmeasures result in cost and CO2 emissions savings compared to a BAU scenario of\n72% and 85% respectively. When these platforms cease production, this is\nfollowed by the repurposing of the platforms into hydrogen generators with up\nto 3.6 GW of electrolysers and the development of up to 5.8 GW of floating\nwind. The generated hydrogen is assumed to power the future transport sector,\nand is delivered to shore in existing and/or new purpose-built pipelines. The\ncontribution of the O&G sector to this hydrogen production amounts to around 19\nTWh, which represents about 2% of total European hydrogen demand for transport\nin 2050. The levelized costs (LCOE) of producing this hydrogen in 2050 are\naround 4 euro2012/kg H2, which is around twice those expected in similar\nstudies. But this does not account for energy policies that may incentivize\ngreen hydrogen production in the future, which would serve to reduce this LCOE\nto a level that is more competitive with other sources.",

    "abstract": "At present, the energy structure of China is shifting towards cleaner and\nlower amounts of carbon fuel, driven by environmental needs and technological\nadvances. Nuclear energy, which is one of the major low-carbon resources, plays\na key role in China's clean energy development. To formulate appropriate energy\npolicies, it is necessary to conduct reliable forecasts. This paper discusses\nthe nuclear energy consumption of China by means of a novel fractional grey\nmodel FAGMO(1,1,k). The fractional accumulated generating matrix is introduced\nto analyse the fractional grey model properties. Thereafter, the modelling\nprocedures of the FAGMO(1,1,k) are presented in detail, along with the\ntransforms of its optimal parameters. A stochastic testing scheme is provided\nto validate the accuracy and properties of the optimal parameters of the\nFAGMO(1,1,k). Finally, this model is used to forecast China's nuclear energy\nconsumption and the results demonstrate that the FAGMO(1,1,k) model provides\naccurate prediction, outperforming other grey models.",

    "title": "Policy Design for Controlling Set-Point Temperature of ACs in Shared Spaces of Buildings",
    "abstract": "Air conditioning systems are responsible for the major percentage of energy\nconsumption in buildings. Shared spaces constitute considerable office space\narea, in which most office employees perform their meetings and daily tasks,\nand therefore the ACs in these areas have significant impact on the energy\nusage of the entire office building. The cost of this energy consumption,\nhowever, is not paid by the shared space users, and the AC's temperature\nset-point is not determined based on the users' preferences. This latter factor\nis compounded by the fact that different people may have different choices of\ntemperature set-points and sensitivities to change of temperature. Therefore,\nit is a challenging task to design an office policy to decide on a particular\nset-point based on such a diverse preference set. As a result, users are not\naware of the energy consumption in shared spaces, which may potentially\nincrease the energy wastage and related cost of office buildings. In this\ncontext, this paper proposes an energy policy for an office shared space by\nexploiting an established temperature control mechanism. In particular, we\nchoose meeting rooms in an office building as the test case and design a policy\naccording to which each user of the room can give a preference on the\ntemperature set-point and is paid for felt discomfort if the set-point is not\nfixed according to the given preference. On the other hand, users who enjoy the\nthermal comfort compensate the other users of the room. Thus, the policy\nenables the users to be cognizant and responsible for the payment on the energy\nconsumption of the office space they are sharing, and at the same time ensures\nthat the users are satisfied either via thermal comfort or through incentives.\nThe policy is also shown to be beneficial for building management. Through\nexperiment based case studies, we show the effectiveness of the proposed\npolicy.",

    "title": "Energy and environmental impacts of air-to-air heat pumps in a mid-latitude city",
    "abstract": "Heat pumps (HPs) have emerged as a key technology for reducing energy use and\ngreenhouse gas emissions. This study evaluates the potential switch to\nair-to-air HPs (AAHPs) in Toulouse, France, where conventional space heating is\nsplit between electric and gas sources. In this context, we find that AAHPs\nreduce heating energy consumption by 57% to 76%, with electric heating energy\nconsumption decreasing by 6% to 47%, resulting in virtually no local\nheating-related CO$_{2}$ emissions. We observe a slight reduction in\nnear-surface air temperature of up to 0.5 {\\deg}C during cold spells,\nattributable to a reduction in sensible heat flux, which is unlikely to\ncompromise AAHPs operational efficiency. While Toulouse's heating energy mix\nfacilitates large energy savings, electric energy consumption may increase in\ncities where gas or other fossil fuel sources prevail. Furthermore, as AAHPs\nefficiency varies with internal and external conditions, their impact on the\nelectrical grid is more complex than conventional heating systems. The results\nunderscore the importance of matching heating system transitions with\nsustainable electricity generation to maximize environmental benefits. The\nstudy highlights the intricate balance between technological advancements in\nheating and their broader environmental and policy implications, offering key\ninsights for urban energy policy and sustainability efforts.",

    "title": "Reinforcement Learning for Sustainable Energy: A Survey",
    "abstract": "The transition to sustainable energy is a key challenge of our time,\nrequiring modifications in the entire pipeline of energy production, storage,\ntransmission, and consumption. At every stage, new sequential decision-making\nchallenges emerge, ranging from the operation of wind farms to the management\nof electrical grids or the scheduling of electric vehicle charging stations.\nAll such problems are well suited for reinforcement learning, the branch of\nmachine learning that learns behavior from data. Therefore, numerous studies\nhave explored the use of reinforcement learning for sustainable energy. This\npaper surveys this literature with the intention of bridging both the\nunderlying research communities: energy and machine learning. After a brief\nintroduction of both fields, we systematically list relevant sustainability\nchallenges, how they can be modeled as a reinforcement learning problem, and\nwhat solution approaches currently exist in the literature. Afterwards, we zoom\nout and identify overarching reinforcement learning themes that appear\nthroughout sustainability, such as multi-agent, offline, and safe reinforcement\nlearning. Lastly, we also cover standardization of environments, which will be\ncrucial for connecting both research fields, and highlight potential directions\nfor future work. In summary, this survey provides an extensive overview of\nreinforcement learning methods for sustainable energy, which may play a vital\nrole in the energy transition.",

    "abstract": "A long-term strategy based on existing technological, ecological, economical,\nand geopolitical realities is urgently needed to develop a sustainable energy\neconomy, which should be designed with adaptability to unpredicted changes in\nany of these aspects. While only a highly diverse energy portfolio and\nconservation can ultimately guarantee optimum sustainability, based on a\ncomparison of current primary energy generation methods, it is argued that\nfuture energy strategy has to rely heavily on expanded coal and nuclear energy\nsectors. A comparison of relative potentials, merits and risks associated with\nfossil-fuel, renewable, and nuclear technologies suggests that the balance of\ntechnologies should be shifted in favor of new-generation, safe nuclear methods\nto produce electricity, while clean-coal plants should be assigned to\ntransportation fuel. Novel nuclear technologies exploit fission of uranium and\nthorium as primary energy sources with fast-spectrum and transmutation (burner)\nreactors. A closed fuel cycle and waste transmutation resolve the strategic\nissues associated with nuclear power. Innovative reactor designs utilize\nspallation of heavy metals in subcritical accelerator driven systems or\nmolten-salt reactors. Importation and reconstruction of technical expertise\nalready lost and aversion of further erosion are preconditions to any\nsuccessful energy strategy. Research opportunities to perfect innovative\nnuclear, coal, and renewable energy technologies should be pursued.",

    "abstract": "Two-dimensional (2D) niobium oxydihalide NbOI$_2$ has been recently\ndemonstrated as an excellent in-plane piezoelectric and nonlinear optical\nmaterials. Here we show that Janus niobium oxydihalide, NbO$XY$ (X, Y = Cl, Br,\nI and X$\\neq$Y), is a multifunctional anisotropic semiconductor family with\nexceptional piezoelectric, electronic, photocatalytic and optical properties.\nNbO$XY$ are stable and mechancially flexible monolayers with band gap around\nthe visible light regime of $\\sim 1.9$ eV. The anisotropic carrier mobility of\nNbO$XY$ lies in the range of $10^3 \\sim 10^4$ cm$^2$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$, which\nrepresents some of the highest among 2D semiconductors of bandgap $\\gtrsim 2$\neV. Inversion symmetry breaking in Janus NbO$XY$ generates sizable out-of-plane\n$d_{31}$ piezoelectric response while still retaining a strong in-plane\npiezoelectricity. Remarkably, NbO$XY$ exhibits an additional out-of-plane\npiezoelectric response, $d_{32}$ as large as 0.55 pm/V. G$_0$W$_0$-BSE\ncalculation further reveals the strong linear optical dichroism of NbO$XY$ in\nthe visible-to-ultraviolet regime. The optical absorption peaks with $14\\sim18$\n\\% in the deep UV regime ($5\\sim6$ eV), outperforming the vast majority of\nother 2D materials. The high carrier mobility, strong optical absorption,\nsizable built-in electric field and band alignment compatible with overall\nwater splitting further suggest the strengths of NbO$XY$ in energy conversion\napplication. We further propose a directional stress sensing device to\ndemonstrate how the out-of-plane piezoelectricity can be harnessed for\nfunctional device applications. Our findings unveil NbO$XY$ as an exceptional\nmultifunctional 2D semiconductor for flexible electronics, optoelectronics, UV\nphotonics, piezoelectric and sustainable energy applications.",

    "abstract": "Harvesting all sources of available clean energy is an essential strategy to\ncontribute to healing current dependence on non-sustainable energy sources.\nRecently, triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) have gained visibility as new\nmechanical energy harvester offering a valid alternative to batteries, being\nparticularly suitable for portable devices. Here, the increased capacitance of\na few-layer graphene-based electrode is obtained by incorporating\nnitrogen-doped graphene (N_graphene), enabling a 3_fold enhancement in TENGs\npower output. The dependence of TENGs performance on the electronic properties\nof different N_graphene types, varying in the doping concentration and in the\nrelative content of N-pyridinic and N-graphitic sites is investigated. These\nsites have different electron affinities, and synergistically contribute to the\nvariation of the capacitive and resistive properties of N-graphene and\nconsequently, TENG performance. It is demonstrated that the power enhancement\nof the TENG occurs when the N_graphene, an n-semiconductor, is interfaced\nbetween the positive triboelectric material and the electrode, while a\ndeterioration of the electrical performance is observed when it is placed at\nthe interface with the negative triboelectric material. This behavior is\nexplained in terms of the dependence of N_graphene quantum capacitance on the\nelectrode chemical potential which shifts according to the opposite\npolarization induced at the two electrodes upon triboelectrification.",

    "abstract": "The degradation mechanism in a sodium cell of a layered\nNa0.48Al0.03Co0.18Ni0.18Mn0.47O2 (NCAM) cathode with P3/P2 structure is\ninvestigated by revealing the changes in microstructure and composition upon\ncycling. The work aims to rationalize the gradual performance decay and the\nalteration of the electrochemical response in terms of polarization, voltage\nsignature, and capacity loss. Spatial reconstructions of the electrode by X-ray\ncomputed tomography at the nanoscale supported by quantitative and qualitative\nanalyses show fractures and deformations in the cycled layered metal-oxide\nparticles, as well as inorganic side compounds deposited on the material. These\nirreversible morphological modifications reflect structural heterogeneities\nacross the cathode particles due to formation of various domains with different\nNa+ intercalation degrees. Besides, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy data\nsuggest that the latter inorganic species in the cycled electrode are mainly\ncomposed of NaF, Na2O, and NaCO3 formed by parasitic electrolyte decomposition.\nThe precipitation of these insulating compounds at the electrode/electrolyte\ninterphase and the related structural stresses induced in the material lead to\na decrease in cathode particle size and partial loss of electrochemical\nactivity. The retention of the NCAM phase after cycling suggests that\nelectrolyte upgrade may improve the performance of the cathode to achieve\npractical application for sustainable energy storage.",

    "abstract": "Integration of renewable energy resources with the electric grid is necessary\nfor a sustainable energy future. However, increased penetration of inverter\nbased resources (IBRs) reduce grid inertia, which might then compromise power\nsystem reliability. Therefore, power utilities are often interested in\nidentifying the maximum IBR penetration limit for their system. The proposed\nresearch presents a methodology to identify the IBR penetration threshold\nbeyond which voltage, frequency, and tie-line limits will be exceeded. The\nsensitivity of the IBR penetration threshold to momentary cessation due to low\nvoltages, transmission versus distribution connected solar generation, and\nstalling of induction motors are also analyzed.

This paper proposes a sustainable energy cooperation\nframework for the building community by communication-efficient peer-to-peer\ntransaction. Firstly, the energy cooperation of buildings is formulated as a\nsocial welfare maximization problem, in which buildings may directly trade\nenergy with neighbors. In addition, considering privacy concerns and\ncommunication losses arisen in peer-to-peer energy trading, a\ncommunication-failure-robust distributed algorithm is developed to achieve the\noptimal energy dispatch solutions.

However, the coordination of sequential markets\nrelies on the exchange of sensitive information between the market operators,\nnamely time series of consumers' loads. To address the privacy concerns arising\nfrom this exchange, this paper introduces a novel privacy-preserving\nStackelberg mechanism (w-PPSM) which generates differentially-private data\nstreams with high fidelity. The proposed w-PPSM enforces the feasibility and\nfidelity of the privacy-preserving data with respect to the original problem\nthrough a post-processing phase in order to achieve a close-to-optimal\ncoordination between the markets. Multiple numerical simulations in a realistic\nenergy system demonstrate the effectiveness of the w-PPSM, which achieves up to\ntwo orders of magnitude reduction in the cost of privacy compared to a\ntraditional differentially-private mechanism.",

    "title": "A System-Level Energy-Efficient Digital Twin Framework for Runtime Control of Batch Manufacturing Processes",
    "abstract": "The manufacturing sector has a substantial influence on worldwide energy\nconsumption. Therefore, improving manufacturing system energy efficiency is\nbecoming increasingly important as the world strives to move toward a more\nresilient and sustainable energy paradigm. Batch processes are a major\ncontributor to energy consumption in manufacturing systems. In batch\nmanufacturing, a number of parts are grouped together before starting a batch\nprocess. To improve the scheduling and control of batch manufacturing\nprocesses, we propose a system-level energy-efficient Digital Twin framework\nthat considers Time-of-Use (TOU) energy pricing for runtime decision-making. As\npart of this framework, we develop a model that combines batch manufacturing\nprocess dynamics and TOU-based energy cost. We also provide an\noptimization-based decision-making algorithm that makes batch scheduling\ndecisions during runtime. A simulated case study showcases the benefits of the\nproposed framework.",

    "title": "Remote Renewable Hubs For Carbon-Neutral Synthetic Fuel Production",
    "abstract": "This paper studies the economics of carbon-neutral synthetic fuel production\nfrom renewable electricity in remote areas where high-quality renewable\nresources are abundant. To this end, a graph-based optimisation modelling\nframework directly applicable to the strategic planning of remote renewable\nenergy supply chains is proposed. More precisely, a hypergraph abstraction of\nplanning problems is introduced, wherein nodes can be viewed as optimisation\nsubproblems with their own parameters, variables, constraints and local\nobjective. Nodes typically represent a subsystem such as a technology, a plant\nor a process. Hyperedges, on the other hand, express the connectivity between\nsubsystems. The framework is leveraged to study the economics of carbon-neutral\nsynthetic methane production from solar and wind energy in North Africa and its\ndelivery to Northwestern European markets. The full supply chain is modelled in\nan integrated fashion, which makes it possible to accurately capture the\ninteraction between various technologies on an hourly time scale. Results\nsuggest that the cost of synthetic methane production and delivery would be\nslightly under 150 EUR/MWh (higher heating value) by 2030 for a system\nsupplying 10 TWh annually and relying on a combination of solar photovoltaic\nand wind power plants, assuming a uniform weighted average cost of capital of\n7%. A comprehensive sensitivity analysis is also carried out in order to assess\nthe impact of various techno-economic parameters and assumptions on synthetic\nmethane cost, including the availability of wind power plants, the investment\ncosts of electrolysis, methanation and direct air capture plants, their\noperational flexibility, the energy consumption of direct air capture plants,\nand financing costs.",

    "abstract": "The transition towards carbon-neutral electricity is one of the biggest game\nchangers in addressing climate change since it addresses the dual challenges of\nremoving carbon emissions from the two largest sectors of emitters: electricity\nand transportation. The transition to a carbon-neutral electric grid poses\nsignificant challenges to conventional paradigms of modern grid planning and\noperation. Much of the challenge arises from the scale of the decision making\nand the uncertainty associated with the energy supply and demand. Artificial\nIntelligence (AI) could potentially have a transformative impact on\naccelerating the speed and scale of carbon-neutral transition, as many decision\nmaking processes in the power grid can be cast as classic, though challenging,\nmachine learning tasks. We point out that to amplify AI's impact on\ncarbon-neutral transition of the electric energy systems, the AI algorithms\noriginally developed for other applications should be tailored in three layers\nof technology, markets, and policy.",

    "abstract": "Purpose : Planning a transition towards sustainable carbon neutrality at the\norganization level raises several accounting challenges. This paper aims to\nshed light on key challenges, highlight answers from current accounting\nstandards and guidance, point out potential inconsistencies or limits, and\noutline potential solutions from the industrial ecology community through\nsystemic environmental assessment tools, such as life cycle assessment (LCA)\nand environmentally-extended input-output (EEIO) analysis.\n  Results and discussion: We propose a Measure-Reduce-Neutralize-Control\nsequence allowing organizations to plan their sustainable net-zero strategy,\nand discuss 24 accounting challenges occurring within this sequence. We then\noutline ways forward for organizations planning their carbon neutrality\ntrajectory, pointing to existing resources, and for guidelines providers and\nthe industrial ecology communities to address current limitations in the\ndevelopment of future accounting methods and guidelines. Overarching solutions\nto many accounting issues are to develop comprehensive, open-source, and\nhigh-quality life cycle inventory databases, to enable improved dynamic\nassessments and prospective LCA through integrated assessment models, to refine\nmethods for assessing mineral scarcity and environmental impacts, the supply in\nsome metals being expected to be a bottleneck to the energy transition, and to\nidentify the appropriate climate metrics for planning sustainable carbon\nneutrality pathways at the organizational level.",

    "abstract": "The increase in anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO$_2$) emissions has\nexacerbated the deterioration of the global environment, which should be\ncontrolled to achieve carbon neutrality. Central to the core goal of achieving\ncarbon neutrality is the utilization of CO$_2$ under economic and sustainable\nconditions. Recently, the strong need for carbon neutrality has led to a\nproliferation of studies on the direct conversion of CO$_2$ into carboxylic\nacids, which could effectively alleviate CO$_2$ emissions and create high-value\nchemicals. The purpose of this review is to present the application prospects\nof carboxylic acids and the basic principles of CO$_2$ conversion into\ncarboxylic acids through photo-, electric-, and thermal catalysis. Special\nattention is focused on the regulation strategy of the activity of abundant\ncatalysts at the molecular level, inspiring the preparation of high-performance\ncatalysts. In addition, theoretical calculation, advanced technologies, and\nnumerous typical examples are introduced to elaborate on the corresponding\nprocess and influencing factors of catalytic activity. Finally, challenges and\nprospects are provided for the future development of this field. It is hoped\nthat this review contributes to a deeper understanding of the conversion of\nCO$_2$ into carboxylic acids and inspires more innovative breakthroughs",

    "title": "Strategic Planning of Carbon-Neutral Heating Demand Coverage Under Uncertainty in a Coupled Multi-Energy Grid",
    "abstract": "Integrating the gas and district heating with the electrical grid in a\nmulti-energy grid has been shown to provide flexibility and prevent bottlenecks\nin the operation of electrical distribution grids. This integration assumes a\ntop-down grid planning approach and a perfect knowledge of consumer behaviour.\nIn reality, consumers decides whether to adopt a heating technology based on\ncosts and government regulation. This behavior is highly uncertain and depends\non fluctuations in heating technology costs and energy prices. The uncertainty\nassociated with consumer behavior increases the risk of investment in grid\nexpansion. In response to this challenge, this paper proposes an approach with\nthe consumer at the center of the planning method. Robust optimization is used\nto model the uncertainty in prices to reduce the risk of investment in grid\nexpansion. The uncertainty in energy prices is modeled using interval\nuncertainty with a proportional deviation. This allows planners, operators and\nregulators to predict the adoption rate of certain heating technology in\ndifferent geographical areas and prioritize the expansion of specific grids\nwhere they are required. By minimizing a cost function subject to robust\nconstraints, the strategy ensures robustness against uncertainties in energy\nprices. This robust optimization approach is applied to Hamburg as a case\nstudy. The result of the optimization represents the consumer's decision. The\nimpact of the consumer's decision on the electrical grid is analzed on\ndifferent benchmark distribution grids. The study concludes that district\nheating expansion in high-density areas is a low-risk investment for carbon\nneutrality. In less dense areas, electrification supports decentralized heat\npumps. Meanwhile, hydrogen gas grids are viable where electric expansion is\nimpractical. Increased uncertainty leads to more conservative solutions.",

    "abstract": "Building on the carbon reduction targets agreed in the Paris Agreements, many\nnations have renewed their efforts toward achieving carbon neutrality by the\nyear 2050. In line with this ambitious goal, nations are seeking to understand\nthe appropriate combination of technologies which will enable the required\nreductions in such a way that they are appealing to investors. Around the\nglobe, solar and wind power lead in terms of renewable energy deployment, while\ncarbon capture and storage (CCS) is scaling up toward making a significant\ncontribution to deep carbon cuts.\n  Using Japan as a case study nation, this research proposes a linear\noptimization modeling approach to identify the potential contributions of\nrenewables and CCS toward maximizing carbon reduction and identifying their\neconomic merits over time. Results identify that the combination of these three\ntechnologies could enable a carbon dioxide emission reduction of between 55 and\n67 percent in the energy sector by 2050 depending on resilience levels and CCS\ndeployment regimes. Further reductions are likely to emerge with increased\ncarbon pricing over time.",

    "abstract": "With increasing concerns over climate change, scientists must imperatively\nacknowledge their share in CO2 emissions. Considering the large emissions\nassociated with scientific traveling - especially international conferences -\ninitiatives to mitigate such impact are blooming. With the COVID-19 pandemic\nshattering our notion of private/professional interactions, the moment should\nbe seized to reinvent science conferences and collaborations with a model\nrespectful of the environment. Yet, despite efforts to reduce the footprint of\nconferences, there is a lack of a robust approach based on reliable numbers\n(emissions, carbon offsetting/removals, etc.) to accompany this shift of\nparadigm. Here, considering a representative scientific society, the\nInternational Adsorption Society, we report on a case study of the problem:\nmaking conferences carbon neutral while respecting the needs of scientists. We\nfirst provide a quantitative analysis of the CO2 emissions for the IAS\nconference in 2022 related to accommodation, catering, flights, etc. Second, we\nconduct two surveys probing our community view on the carbon footprint of our\nactivities. These surveys mirror each other, and were distributed two years\nbefore and in the aftermath of our triennial conference (also corresponding to\npre/post COVID times).

    "abstract": "In the context of increasing global climate change, decarbonizing the\nresidential building sector is crucial for sustainable development. This study\naims to analyze the role of various influencing factors in carbon intensity\nchanges using the decomposing structural decomposition (DSD) to assess and\ncompare the potential and effectiveness of electrifying end-use activities\nduring the operational phase of residential buildings worldwide for\ndecarbonization. The results show that (1) while the electrification rate\nvaried in its impact on emissions across different countries and regions, the\noverall increase in electrification contributed to higher carbon intensity. In\ncontrast, changes in the emission factor of electricity generally made a\npositive contribution to emission reduction globally. (2) The global\nelectrification level has significantly increased, with the electrification\nrate rising from 29.9% in 2000 to 40.1% in 2021. A 39.8% increase in the\nelectricity-related carbon emissions of global residential buildings was\nobserved, increasing from 1452 MtCO2 to 2032 MtCO2, 2000-2021. (3) From 2000 to\n2021, electrification of space heating was the main contributor to carbon\nreduction, whereas the contributions of electrification to cooling and lighting\nwere relatively limited. Emission reductions from appliances and others\nremained stable. The electrification of water heating and cooking had varying\neffects on emission reductions in different countries. Furthermore, this study\nproposes a series of electrification decarbonization strategies. Overall, this\nstudy analyzes and contrasts decarbonization efforts from building\nelectrification at the global and regional levels, explores the key motivations\nbehind these efforts to aid national net-zero emission targets and accelerate\nthe transition of the global residential building sector toward a\ncarbon-neutral future.",

In this\ncontext, it is crucial to help national policymakers to choose the most\nappropriate technologies to achieve these goals and energy system modelling can\nbe a valuable tool. This article presents a model of the Italian power system\nrealized employing the open energy modelling framework Oemof. A Linear\nProgramming Optimization is implemented to evaluate how to minimise system\ncosts at decreasing CO2 emissions in 2030. The developed tool is applied to\nevaluate different research questions: i) pathway towards full decarbonization\nand power self-sufficiency of the electricity sector in Italy, ii) relevance of\nflexibility assets in power grids: li-ion batteries, hydrogen storage and\ntransmission lines reinforcement. A 55% CO2 emissions reduction for the actual\nItalian power sector can be achieved through an increase of 30% of the total\nannual system cost. Full decarbonization can be reached with four times today's\nannual costs, which could be lowered with sector coupling and considering more\ntechnologies.",

A 40 year hourly energy\nbalance model is presented of Japan's electricity system using historical data.\nPumped hydro energy storage, high voltage interconnection and dispatchable\ncapacity (hydro, biomass and hydrogen energy) are included to balance variable\ngeneration and demand. Differential evolution is used to find the least-cost\nsolution under various constraints. The levelized cost of electricity is found\nto be USD 86 per MWh for a PV-dominated system, and USD 110 per MWh for a\nwind-dominated system. These costs can be compared with the average system\nprices on the spot market in Japan of USD 102 per MWh. In summary, Japan can be\nself-sufficient for electricity supply at competitive costs.",

In addition, renewable energy curtailment in the\npower distribution system, as well as low efficiency due to independent\noperation of traditional energy systems, has been addressed by the application\nof integrated energy system (IES) to some extent. In this paper, we propose a\nplanning method for low-carbon building-level IES, in which electric vehicles\n(EV) and the mode of Vehicle to Grid (V2G) are considered and further increase\nthe flexibility of low-carbon buildings. The proposed planning model optimize\nthe investment, operation costs and CO2 emission for building-level IES, so as\nto achieve the maximum benefit of the construction of the low-carbon building\nand help the realization of carbon neutrality. Moreover, we consider the\nuncertainty of distributed renewable energy, multi-energy load fluctuation and\nthe random behavior of EV users, then formulating a two-stage stochastic\nprogramming model with chance constraints, in which heuristic moment matching\nscenario generation (HMMSG) and sample average approximation (SAA) method are\napplied.

The\ncommitment of fully renewable energy accommodation and utilization while\nensuring the extreme high reliability has brought significant challenges on\nsystem operation due to the stochastic nature of the renewables. The battery\nenergy storage system (BESS) composed of stationary energy storage system\n(SESS) and shared mobile energy storage system (MESS) can be utilized to meet\nthe requirements of short-term load surges, renewable accommodation and\nemergency power supply for important loads during the mega-event.

On the other hand, the low ambient temperature of\nWinter Olympic game has significant impact on BESSs degradation and performance\nwhich need to be integrated to the charging and discharging model of BESS. To\nthis end, a joint two-stage optimal configuration method considering the\nambient temperature of SESS and MESS has been developed to support the\nmega-event carbon neutrality, to reduce redundant BESS capacity allocation and\nimprove the system life cycle cost-benefit.

    "abstract": "Power system transient stability has been translated into a Lyapunov\nstability problem of the post-disturbance equilibrium for decades. Despite\nsubstantial results, conventional theories suffer from the stringent\nrequirement of knowing the post-disturbance equilibrium a priori. In contrast,\nthe wisdom from practice, which certificates stability by only the observation\nof converging frequencies and voltages, seems to provide an\nequilibrium-independent approach. Here, we formulate the empirical wisdom by\nthe concept of augmented synchronization and aim to bridge such a\ntheory-practice gap. First, we derive conditions under which the convergence to\naugmented synchronization implies the convergence to the equilibrium set,\nlaying the first theoretical foundation for the empirical wisdom. Then, we\nreveal from what initial values the power system can achieve augmented\nsynchronization. Our results open the possibility of an equilibrium-independent\npower system stability analytic that re-defines the nominal motion as augmented\nsynchronization rather than certain equilibrium. Single-machine examples and\nthe IEEE 9-bus system well verify our results and illustrate promising\nimplications.",

Evidently, these power systems without fuel will be environmentally\nbenign, sustainable, and subject to milder failure scenarios. Many of these\nadvantages were projected decades ago with the definition of the soft energy\npath, which describes a future where all energy is provided by numerous small,\nsimple, and diverse renewable sources. Here we provide a thorough investigation\nof power systems without fuel from technical and economic standpoints. The\npaper is organized by timescale and covers issues like the irrelevance of unit\ncommitment in networks without large, fuel-based generators, the dubiousness of\nnodal pricing without fuel costs, and the need for new system-level models and\ncontrol methods for semiconductor-based energy-conversion interfaces.",

    "abstract": "The increasing penetration of variable renewable energy (VRE) has brought\nsignificant challenges for power systems planning and operation. These highly\nvariable sources are typically distributed in the grid; therefore, a detailed\nrepresentation of transmission bottlenecks is fundamental to approximate the\nimpact of the transmission network on the dispatch with VRE resources. The fine\ngrain temporal scale of short term and day-ahead dispatch, taking into account\nthe network constraints, also mandatory for mid-term planning studies, combined\nwith the high variability of the VRE has brought the need to represent these\nuncertainties in stochastic optimization models while taking into account the\ntransmission system. These requirements impose a computational burden to solve\nthe planning and operation models. We propose a methodology based on community\ndetection to aggregate the network representation, capable of preserving the\nlocational marginal price (LMP) differences in multiple VRE scenarios, and\ndescribe a real-world operational planning study. The optimal expected cost\nsolution considering aggregated networks is compared with the full network\nrepresentation. Both representations were embedded in an operation model\nrelying on Stochastic Dual Dynamic Programming (SDDP) to deal with the random\nvariables in a multi-stage problem.",

    "abstract": "Dynamic power system models are instrumental in real-time stability,\nmonitoring, and control. Such models are traditionally posed as systems of\nnonlinear differential algebraic equations (DAEs): the dynamical part models\ngenerator transients and the algebraic one captures network power flow. While\nthe literature on control and monitoring for ordinary differential equation\n(ODE) models of power systems is indeed rich, that on DAE systems is\n\\textit{not}. DAE system theory is less understood in the context of power\nsystem dynamics. To that end, this letter presents two new mathematical\ntransformations for nonlinear DAE models that yield nonlinear ODE models whilst\nretaining the complete nonlinear DAE structure and algebraic variables. Such\ntransformations make (more accurate) power system DAE models more amenable to a\nhost of control and state estimation algorithms designed for ODE dynamical\nsystems. We showcase that the proposed models are effective, simple, and\ncomputationally scalable.",

    "title": "The Sensitivity of Power System Expansion Models",
    "abstract": "Power system expansion models are a widely used tool for planning\npowersystems, especially considering the integration of large shares of\nrenewableresources. The backbone of these models is an optimization problem,\nwhichdepends on a number of economic and technical parameters. Although\ntheseparameters contain significant uncertainties, the sensitivity of power\nsystemmodels to these uncertainties is barely investigated. In this work, we\nintroduce a novel method to quantify the sensitivity ofpower system models to\ndifferent model parameters based on measuring theadditional cost arising from\nmisallocating generation capacities. The value ofthis method is proven by three\nprominent test cases: the definition of capitalcost, different weather periods\nand different spatial and temporal resolutions.We find that the model is most\nsensitive to the temporal resolution. Fur-thermore, we explain why the spatial\nresolution is of minor importance andwhy the underlying weather data should be\nchosen carefully.",

    "title": "Scalable Neural Dynamic Equivalence for Power Systems",
    "abstract": "Traditional grid analytics are model-based, relying strongly on accurate\nmodels of power systems, especially the dynamic models of generators,\ncontrollers, loads and other dynamic components. However, acquiring thorough\npower system models can be impractical in real operation due to inaccessible\nsystem parameters and privacy of consumers, which necessitate data-driven\ndynamic equivalencing of unknown subsystems. Learning reliable dynamic\nequivalent models for the external systems from SCADA and PMU data, however, is\na long-standing intractable problem in power system analysis due to complicated\nnonlinearity and unforeseeable dynamic modes of power systems. This paper\nadvances a practical application of neural dynamic equivalence (NeuDyE) called\nDriving Port NeuDyE (DP-NeuDyE), which exploits physics-informed machine\nlearning and neural-ordinary-differential-equations (ODE-NET) to discover a\ndynamic equivalence of external power grids while preserving its dynamic\nbehaviors after disturbances. The new contributions are threefold: A NeuDyE\nformulation to enable a continuous-time, data-driven dynamic equivalence of\npower systems, saving the effort and expense of acquiring inaccessible system;\nAn introduction of a Physics-Informed NeuDyE learning (PI-NeuDyE) to actively\ncontrol the closed-loop accuracy of NeuDyE; and A DP-NeuDyE to reduce the\nnumber of inputs required for the training. We conduct extensive case studies\non the NPCC system to validate the generalizability and accuracy of both\nPI-NeuDyE and DP-NeuDyE, which span a multitude of scenarios, differing in the\ntime required for fault clearance, the specific fault locations, and the\nlimitations of data. Test results have demonstrated the scalability and\npracticality of NeuDyE, showing its potential to be used in ISO and utility\ncontrol centers for online transient stability analysis and for planning\npurposes.",

The analysis is based on a real-world large-scale low-inertia power\nsystem namely, the All-Island transmission system (AITS) of Ireland and\nNorthern Ireland currently accommodating up to 75% of non-synchronous\ngeneration. The paper is motivated by a recent trend of some frequency quality\nparameters such as the standard frequency deviation and the slow frequency\nrestoration. The paper first discusses the frequency control services currently\nin place to ensure frequency quality in the AITS. An analysis of the frequency\nquality parameters of the AITS is then presented based on actual data. The\npaper also discusses, through an illustrative example, the effectiveness of\nautomatic generation control as a potential approach to keep frequency within\nthe operational range.",

    "abstract": "Reliable and secure operation of power systems becomes increasingly\nchallenging as the share of volatile generation rises, leading to largely\nchanging dynamics. Typically, the architecture and structure of controllers in\npower systems, such as voltage controllers of power generators, are fixed\nduring the design and buildup of the network. As replacing existing controllers\nis often undesired and challenging, setpoint adjustments, as well as tuning of\nthe controller parameters, are possibilities to counteract large disturbances\nand changing dynamics. We present an approach for fast and computationally\nefficient adaptation of parameters of structured controllers based on\nH-infinity optimization, also referred to as structured H-infinity controller\nsynthesis, tailored towards power systems. Conditions are established that\nguarantee that the approach leads to stability.The results are verified in a\ntestbed microgrid consisting of six inverters and a load bank, as well as\nsimulation studies. The proposed method improves the system robustness, as well\nas the time-response to step disturbances and allows structured controller\ntuning even for large networks.",

    "title": "Descriptor State Space Modeling of Power Systems",
    "abstract": "State space is widely used for modeling power systems and analyzing their\ndynamics but it is limited to representing causal and proper systems in which\nthe number of zeros does not exceed the number of poles. In other words, the\nsystem input, output, and state can not be freely selected. This limits how\nflexibly models are constructed, and in some circumstances, can introduce\nerrors because of the addition of virtual elements in order to connect the\nmismatched ports of subsystem models. An extension known as descriptor state\nspace can model both proper and improper systems and is a promising candidate\nfor solving the noted problems. It facilitates a modular construction of power\nsystem models with flexible choice of ports of subsystems. Algorithms for\nmathematical manipulation of descriptor state space models are derived such as\npreforming inverse, connection, and transform. Corresponding physical\ninterpretations are also given. Importantly, the proposed algorithms preserve\nthe subsystem states in the whole system model, which therefore enables the\nanalysis of root causes of instability and mode participation. Theoretical\nadvances are validated by example power systems of varied scales including a\nsingle-inductor or -capacitor system, two-inductor or -capacitor system, and a\nmodified IEEE 14-bus generator-inverter-composite system.",

    "abstract": "Modern society's reliance on power systems is at risk from the escalating\neffects of wind-related climate change. Yet, failure to identify the intricate\nrelationship between wind-related climate risks and power systems could lead to\nserious short- and long-term issues, including partial or complete blackouts.\nHere, we develop a comprehensive framework to assess China's power system\nresilience across various climate change scenarios, enabling a holistic\nevaluation of the repercussions induced by wind-related climate change. Our\nfindings indicate that China's current wind projects and planning strategies\ncould be jeopardized by wind-related climate change, with up to a 12\\% decline\nin regional wind power availability. Moreover, our results underscore a\npronounced vulnerability of power system resilience amidst the rigors of\nhastened climate change, unveiling a potential amplification of resilience\ndeterioration, even approaching fourfold by 2060 under the most severe\nscenario, relative to the 2020 benchmark. This work advocates for strategic\nfinancial deployment within the power sector aimed at climate adaptation,\nenhancing power system resilience to avert profound losses from long-term,\nwind-influenced climatic fluctuations.",

The spreading droplet in touch with the top electrode can be equivalently\nregarded as an additional part of the top plate of the DEG capacitor, and the\nchange of droplet area causes the change of surface charge density of the\nplates, driving electrons to migrate between the two plates.

    "abstract": "Pyroelectric energy converter is a functional capacitor using pyroelectric\nmaterial as the dielectric layer. Utilizing the first-order phase\ntransformation of the material, the pyroelectric device can generate adequate\nelectricity within small temperature fluctuations. However, most pyroelectric\ncapacitors are leaking during energy conversion. In this paper, we analyze the\nthermodynamics of pyroelectric energy conversion with consideration of the\nelectric leakage. Our thermodynamic model is verified by experiments using\nthree phase-transforming ferroelectric materials with different pyroelectric\nproperties and leakage behaviors. We demonstrate that the impact of leakage for\nelectric generation is prominent, and sometimes may be confused with the actual\npower generation by pyroelectricity. We discover an ideal material candidate,\n(Ba,Ca)(Ti,Zr,Ce)O$_3$, which exhibits large pyroelectric current and extremely\nlow leakage current. The pyroelectric converter made of this material generates\n1.95 $\\mu$A/cm$^2$ pyroelectric current density and 0.2 J/cm$^3$ pyroelectric\nwork density even after 1389 thermodynamic conversion cycles.",

    "abstract": "Liquid electricity generator and hydrovoltaic technology have received\nnumerous attentions, which can be divided into horizontal movement generator\nand vertical movement generator. The horizontal movement generator is limited\nfor powering the integrated and miniaturized energy chip as the current output\ndirection is depending on the moving direction of the water droplet, which\nmeans a sustainable and continuous direct-current (DC) electricity output can\nbe hardly achieved because of the film of limited length. On the other hand,\nthe existing vertical movement generators include triboelectricity or humidity\ngradient-based liquid electricity generator, where the liquid or water resource\nmust be sustainably supplied to ensure continuous current output. Herein, we\nhave designed an integratable vertical generator by sandwiching water droplets\nwith semiconductor and metal, such as graphene or aluminum. This generator,\nnamed as polarized liquid molecular generator (PLMG), directly converts the\nlateral kinetic energy of water droplet into vertical DC electricity with an\noutput voltage of up to ~1.0 V from the dynamic water-semiconductor interface.\nThe fundamental discovery of PLMG is related to the non-symmetric structure of\nliquid molecules, such as water and alcohols, which can be polarized under the\nguidance of built-in field caused by the Fermi level difference between metal\nand semiconductor, while the symmetric liquid molecules cannot produce any\nelectricity on the opposite. Integratable PLMG with a large output power of ~90\nnW and voltage of ~2.7 V has been demonstrated, meanwhile its small internal\nresistance of ~250 kilohm takes a huge advantage in resistance matching with\nthe impedance of electron components. The PLMG shows potential application\nvalue in the Internet of Things (IoTs) after proper miniaturization and\nintegration.",

    "abstract": "Electric energy generation from falling droplets has seen a hundred-fold rise\nin efficiency over the past year. However, even these newest devices can only\nextract a small portion of the droplet energy. In this paper, we theoretically\ninvestigate the contributions of hydrodynamic and electric losses in limiting\nthe efficiency of droplet electricity generators (DEG). Noting that the\nelectro-mechanical energy conversion occurs during the recoil that immediately\nfollows droplet impact, we identify three limits on existing droplet electric\ngenerators: (i) the impingement velocity is limited in order to maintain the\ndroplet integrity; (ii) much of droplet mechanical energy is squandered in\novercoming viscous shear force with the substrate; (iii) insufficient\nelectrical charge of the substrate. Of all these effects, we found that up to\n83% of the total energy available was lost by viscous dissipation during\nspreading. Minimizing this loss by using cascaded DEG devices to reduce the\ndroplet kinetic energy may increase future devices efficiency beyond 10%.",

    "abstract": "Diesel electric generators are an inherent part of remote hybrid microgrids\nfound in remote regions of the world that provide primary frequency response\n(PFR) to restore system frequency during load or generation changes. However,\nwith inverter-based resources (IBR) integration into microgrids, the IBR\ncontrol provides a fast frequency response (FFR) to restore the system\nfrequency. Hence, supplementing PFR with FFR requires a sophisticated control\nsystem and a high fidelity diesel electric generator model to design these\ncontrol systems. In this work, a high-fidelity model of a diesel electric\ngenerator is developed. Its parameters are tuned using a surrogate optimization\nalgorithm by emulating its response during a load change to a 400 kVA\nCaterpillar C-15 diesel generator, similar to those found in remote microgrids.\nThe diesel electric generator model consists of a synchronous machine, DC4B\nexcitation with V/Hz limiter, and a proposed modified IEEE GGOV1\nengine-governor model (GGOV1D). The performance of the GGOV1D is compared with\nsimple, Woodward DEGOV, and a standard IEEE GGOV1 engine-governor model.\nResults show that error in the diesel electric generator's response to load\nchanges using the GGOV1D model is lower with an improved frequency response\nduring the arresting and rebound period than the other engine-governor models.",

Antiferromagnets have been shown to host\nversions of these textures, which have gained significant attention because of\ntheir potential for terahertz dynamics, deflection free motion, and improved\nsize scaling due to the absence of stray field. Here we show that topological\nspin textures, merons and antimerons, can be generated at room temperature and\nreversibly moved using electrical pulses in thin film CuMnAs, a semimetallic\nantiferromagnet that is a testbed system for spintronic applications. The\nelectrical generation and manipulation of antiferromagnetic merons is a crucial\nstep towards realizing the full potential of antiferromagnetic thin films as\nactive components in high density, high speed magnetic memory devices.",

Herein, we demonstrate a wind driven semiconductor\nelectricity generator based on a dynamic Schottky junction, which can output a\ncontinuous direct current with an average value of 4.4 mA (the maximum value of\n8.4 mA) over 360 seconds. Compared with the previous metal/semiconductor\ngenerator, the output current is one thousand times higher. Furthermore, this\nwind driven generator has been explored to function as a turn counter due to\nits stable output and also to drive a graphene ultraviolet photodetector, which\nshows a responsivity of 35.8 A/W under the 365 nm ultraviolet light.

    "abstract": "The challenge in solar energy today is not the cost of photovoltaic (PV)\nelectricity generation, already competing with fossil fuel prices, but rather\nutility-scale energy storage and flexibility in supply. Low-cost thermal energy\nstorage (TES) exists but relies on expensive heat engines. Here, we introduce\nthe concept of luminescent solar power (LSP), where sunlight is absorbed in a\nphotoluminescent (PL) absorber, followed by red-shifted PL emission matched to\nan adjacent PV cell's band-edge. This way the PV cell operates nearly as\nefficiently as under direct illumination, but with minimal excessive heat. The\nPL-absorber temperature rises due to thermalization, allowing it to store the\nexcessive heat, which can later be converted into electricity. Tailored\nluminescent materials that support an additional 1.5kWh PV-electricity for\nevery 1 kWh of (virtual) heat engine-electricity, with a dynamic shift between\nthe two sources are experimentally demonstrated. Such an ideal hybrid system\nmay lead to a potential reduction in the cost of electricity for a base-load\nsolution.",

    "title": "Open-data based carbon emission intensity signals for electricity generation in European countries -- top down vs. bottom up approach",
    "abstract": "Dynamic grid emission factors provide a temporally resolved signal about the\ncarbon intensity of electricity generation in the power system. Since actual\ncarbon dioxide emission measurements are usually lacking, such a signal must be\nderived from system-specific emission factors combined with power generation\ntime series. We present a bottom-up method that allows deriving per country and\nper technology emission factors for European countries based on plant specific\npower generation time series and reported emissions from the European emissions\ntrading mechanism. We have matched, 595 fossil generation units and their\nrespective annual emissions. In 2018, these power plants supplied 717 TWh of\nelectricity to the grid, representing approximately 50 % of power generation\nfrom fossil fuels. Based on this dataset, 42 individual technology and\ncountry-specific emission factors are derived. The resulting values for\nhistorical per country carbon intensity of electricity generation are compared\nwith corresponding results from a top-down approach, which uses statistical\ndata on emissions and power generation on national scales. All calculations are\nbased on publicly available data, such that the analysis is transparent and the\nmethod can be replicated, adjusted and expanded in a flexible way.",

    "title": "Electrical generation and propagation of spin waves in antiferromagnetic thin films",
    "abstract": "Electrical generation of THz spin waves is theoretically explored in an\nantiferromangetic nanostrip via the current-induced spin-orbit torque. The\nanalysis based on micromagnetic simulations clearly illustrates that the\nNeel-vector oscillations excited at one end of the magnetic strip can propagate\nin the form of a traveling wave when the nanostrip axis aligns with the\nmagnetic easy-axis. A sizable threshold is observed in the driving current\ndensity or the torque to overcome the unfavorable anisotropy as expected. The\ngenerated spin waves are found to travel over a long distance while the angle\nof rotation undergoes continuous decay in the presence of non-zero damping. The\noscillation frequency is tunable via the strength of the spin-orbit torque,\nreaching the THz regime. Other key characteristics of the spin waves such as\nthe phase and the chirality can also be modulated actively. The simulation\nresults further indicate the possibility of wave-like superposition between the\nexcited spin oscillations, illustrating its application as an efficient source\nof spin-wave signals for information processing.",

    "abstract": "One of the most complex and devastating disaster scenarios that the\nU.S.~Pacific Northwest region and the state of Oregon faces is a large\nmagnitude Cascadia Subduction Zone earthquake event. The region's electrical\ngrid lacks in resilience against the destruction of a megathrust earthquake, a\npowerful tsunami, hundreds of aftershocks and increased volcanic activity, all\nof which are highly probable components of this hazard. This research seeks to\ncatalyze further understanding and improvement of resilience. By systematizing\npower system related experiences of historical earthquakes, and collecting\npractical and innovative ideas from other regions on how to enhance network\ndesign, construction, and operation, important steps are being taken toward a\nmore resilient, earthquake-resistant grid. This paper presents relevant\nfindings in an effort to be an overview and a useful guideline for those who\nare also working towards greater electrical grid resilience.",

    "abstract": "High energy consumption of artificial intelligence has gained momentum\nworldwide, which necessitates major investments on expanding efficient and\ncarbon-neutral generation and data center infrastructure in electric power\ngrids. Going beyond the conventional ideation, this article unleashes innate\ncomputational abilities in the power grid network circuits itself. By\nprogramming power electronic converters (PECs) to mimic biological neurons, we\nsustainably transform power grids into a neural network and enable it to\noptimize, compute and make data-driven decisions using distributed PECs.\nInstead of seen merely as an energy delivery platform, this article\nconceptualizes a novel application for electric grid to be used as a computing\nasset without affecting its operation. To illustrate its computational\nabilities, we solve a affine transformation task in a microgrid with five PECs.\nBy encoding the digital data into the control of PECs, our preliminary results\nconclude that computing using electric grids does not disturb its operation.\nFrom a scientific perspective, this work fundamentally merges energy and\ncomputing optimization theories by harnessing inherent high-dimensional\ncomputational relationships in electric grids.",

    "abstract": "The energy transition towards high shares of renewable energy will affect the\nstability of electricity grids in many ways. Here, we aim to study its impact\non propagation of disturbances by solving nonlinear swing equations describing\ncoupled rotating masses of synchronous generators and motors on different grid\ntopologies. We consider a tree, a square grid and as a real grid topology, the\nGerman transmission grid. We identify ranges of parameters with different\ntransient dynamics: the disturbance decays exponentially in time, superimposed\nby oscillations with the fast decay rate of a single node, or with a smaller\ndecay rate without oscillations. Most remarkably, as the grid inertia is\nlowered, nodes may become correlated, slowing down the propagation from\nballistic to diffusive motion, decaying with a power law in time. Applying\nlinear response theory, we show that tree grids have a spectral gap leading to\nexponential relaxation as protected by topology and independent on grid size.\nMeshed grids are found to have a spectral gap which decreases with increasing\ngrid size, leading to slow power law relaxation and collective diffusive\npropagation of disturbances. We conclude by discussing consequences if no\nmeasures are undertaken to preserve the grid inertia in the energy transition.",

This process, involving detailed\ntransient simulations, usually leads to a notion of a system-wide inertia\nfloor. Ongoing questions in this analysis are in how to set the inertial floor\nand to what extent the location of frequency control resources matters. This\npaper proposes a new analysis technique that quantifies theoretical locational\nrate of change of frequency (ROCOF) as a computationally efficient screening\nalgorithm scalable to large systems. An additional challenge in moving this\narea forward is the lack of high-quality, public benchmark dynamics cases. This\npaper presents a synthetic case for such purposes and a methodology for\nvalidation, to ensure that it is well suited to inertia adequacy studies to\nimprove electric grid performance.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a method to better integrate dynamic models for renewable\nresources into synthetic electric grids. An automated dynamic models assignment\nprocess is proposed for wind and solar generators. A realistic composition\nratio for different types of wind turbine generators (WTG) is assigned to each\nwind generator. Statistics summarized from real electric grid data form the\nbases in assigning proper models with reasonable parameters to each WTG. A\nsimilar process is used to assign appropriate models and parameters to each\nphotovoltaic (PV) generator. Multiple control strategies of the renewable\nresources are considered and tested in case studies. Two large-scale synthetic\nnetwork test cases are used as examples of modeling the dynamics of renewable\ngenerators. Several transient stability metrics are adopted to assess the\nstability level after being subject to N-1 contingency event. Representative\ncontingency events are given to demonstrate the performance of the synthetic\nrenewable generator models.",

However,\nto enable this ability, the electrolyzer system should be able to control both\nactive and reactive power in coordination with the low-level controller of the\nelectrolyzer via the power electronics system interface between the utility\ngrid and electrolyzer. This paper discusses power converter topologies and the\ncontrol scheme of this power electronics interface for electrolyzer\napplications to enable electricity grid services.

    "abstract": "Electricity grids have become an essential part of daily life, even if they\nare often not noticed in everyday life. We usually only become particularly\naware of this dependence by the time the electricity grid is no longer\navailable. However, significant changes, such as the transition to renewable\nenergy (photovoltaic, wind turbines, etc.) and an increasing number of energy\nconsumers with complex load profiles (electric vehicles, home battery systems,\netc.), pose new challenges for the electricity grid. To address these\nchallenges, we propose two first-of-its-kind datasets based on measurements in\na broadband powerline communications (PLC) infrastructure. Both datasets FiN-1\nand FiN-2, were collected during real practical use in a part of the German\nlow-voltage grid that supplies around 4.4 million people and show more than 13\nbillion datapoints collected by more than 5100 sensors. In addition, we present\ndifferent use cases in asset management, grid state visualization, forecasting,\npredictive maintenance, and novelty detection to highlight the benefits of\nthese types of data. For these applications, we particularly highlight the use\nof novel machine learning architectures to extract rich information from\nreal-world data that cannot be captured using traditional approaches. By\npublishing the first large-scale real-world dataset, we aim to shed light on\nthe previously largely unrecognized potential of PLC data and emphasize\nmachine-learning-based research in low-voltage distribution networks by\npresenting a variety of different use cases.",

    "title": "Algorithms for Mitigating the Effect of Uncertain Geomagnetic Disturbances in Electric Grids",
    "abstract": "Geomagnetic disturbances (GMDs), a result of space weather, pose a severe\nrisk to electric grids. When GMDs occur, they can cause geomagnetically-induced\ncurrents (GICs), which saturate transformers, induce hot-spot heating, and\nincrease reactive power losses in the transmission grid. Furthermore,\nuncertainty in the magnitude and orientation of the geo-electric field, and\ninsufficient historical data make the problem of mitigating the effects of\nuncertain GMDs challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel distributionally\nrobust optimization (DRO) approach that models uncertain GMDs and mitigates the\neffects of GICs on electric grids. This is achieved via a set of mitigation\nactions (e.g., line switching, locating blocking devices, generator re-dispatch\nand load shedding), prior to the GMD event, such that the worst-case\nexpectation of the system cost is minimized. To this end, we develop a\ncolumn-and-constraint generation algorithm that solves a sequence of\nmixed-integer second-order conic programs to handle the underlying convex\nsupport set of the uncertain GMDs. Also, we present a monolithic exact\nreformulation of our DRO model when the underlying support set can be\napproximated by a polytope with three extreme points. Numerical experiments on\n'epri-21' system show the efficacy of the proposed algorithms and the exact\nreformulation of our DRO model.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel taxonomy of coordination strategies for\ndistributed energy resources at the edge of the electricity grid, based on a\nsystematic analysis of key literature trends. The coordination of distributed\nenergy resources such as decentralised generation and flexibility sources is\ncritical for decarbonising electricity and achieving climate goals. The\nliterature on the topic is growing exponentially; however, there is ambiguity\nin the terminology used to date. We seek to resolve this lack of clarity by\nsynthesising the categories of coordination strategies in a novel exhaustive,\nmutually exclusive taxonomy based on agency, information and game type. The\nrelevance of these concepts in the literature is illustrated through a\nsystematic literature review of 84,741 publications using a structured topic\nsearch query. Then 93 selected coordination strategies are analysed in more\ndetail and mapped onto this framework. Clarity on structural assumptions is key\nfor selecting appropriate coordination strategies for differing contexts within\nenergy systems. We argue that a plurality of complementary strategies is needed\nto coordinate energy systems' different components and achieve deep\ndecarbonisation.",

Given a\nfixed complex network topology with specific governing dynamics, the proposed\nframework finds an optimal allocation of edge weights that minimizes such\nvulnerability measure(s) at the node(s) for which we expect perturbations to\noccur by solving a tractable semidefinite programming problem. We specify the\nmathematical model to high voltage electric grids where each node corresponds\nto a voltage phase angle associated with a bus and edges correspond to\ntransmission lines. Edge weights are determined by the susceptance values along\nthe transmission lines. In this application, frequency synchronization is\nincreasingly challenged by the integration of renewable energy, yet is\nimperative to the grid's health and functionality. Our framework helps to\nalleviate this challenge by optimizing the placement of renewable generation\nand the susceptance values along the transmission lines.",

    "abstract": "The electricity grid has evolved from a physical system to a cyber-physical\nsystem with digital devices that perform measurement, control, communication,\ncomputation, and actuation. The increased penetration of distributed energy\nresources (DERs) including renewable generation, flexible loads, and storage\nprovides extraordinary opportunities for improvements in efficiency and\nsustainability. However, they can introduce new vulnerabilities in the form of\ncyberattacks, which can cause significant challenges in ensuring grid\nresilience. We propose a framework in this paper for achieving grid resilience\nthrough suitably coordinated assets including a network of Internet of Things\n(IoT) devices. A local electricity market is proposed to identify trustable\nassets and carry out this coordination. Situational Awareness (SA) of locally\navailable DERs with the ability to inject power or reduce consumption is\nenabled by the market, together with a monitoring procedure for their\ntrustability and commitment. With this SA, we show that a variety of\ncyberattacks can be mitigated using local trustable resources without stressing\nthe bulk grid. Multiple demonstrations are carried out using a high-fidelity\nco-simulation platform, real-time hardware-in-the-loop validation, and a\nutility-friendly simulator.",

Smart grid provides highly consistent and reliable services, efficient\nenergy management practices, smart metering integration, automation and\nprecision decision support systems and self-healing facilities. The smart power\ngrid introduces a sensing, monitoring, and control system that provides end\nusers with the cost of energy at any moment through real-time pricing. The\nclassical power system operation has no control over the loads except in an\nemergency situation when a portion of the loads can be dropped as needed to\nbalance the power grid generation with its loads. Furthermore, the smart power\ngrid supplies the platform for the use of renewable energy sources that acts as\na safeguard against a complete blackout of the interconnected power grid. In\nthis work, all the concepts involved in smart grid mechanism is implemented\nwith PIC18F452 microcontroller and other supplementary components. A solar\nmodule with storage capacity is connected to the proposed system for minimizing\ngrid energy consumption and plays a primary energy source for maximum\nutilization of green energy. This intelligent device may inherently reduce the\nconsumption of electrical energy during peak hours and allow consumers to sell\nback electricity into grid using bi-directional technique.

    "abstract": "Smart grids integrate communication systems with power networks to enable\npower grids operation and command through real-time data collection and control\nsignals. Designing, analyzing, and simulating smart grid infrastructures as\nwell as predicting the impact of power network failures strongly depend on the\ntopologies of the underlying power network and communication system. Despite\nthe substantial impact that the communication systems bring to smart grid\noperation, the topology of communication systems employed in smart grids was\nless studied. The power community lacks realistic generative communication\nsystem models that can be calibrated to match real-world data. To address this\nissue, this paper proposes a framework to generate the underlying topological\ngraphs for the communication systems deployed in smart grids by mimicking the\ntopology of real-world smart grids. In this regard, we have updated the\nChung-Lu algorithm to guarantee the communication network connectivity and to\nmatch the degree distribution of a real-world smart grid rather than following\nan expected degree distribution. In addition, key characteristics of\ncommunication systems such as diameter, average shortest paths, clustering\ncoefficients, assortativity, and spectral gap were taken into consideration to\ngenerate the most similar real-world communication network for smart grid\nstudies. We believe that the proposed algorithm to generate realistic cyber\ngraphs for smart grid studies will benefit the power community.",

    "abstract": "The concept of smart grid has been introduced as a new vision of the\nconventional power grid to figure out an efficient way of integrating green and\nrenewable energy technologies. In this way, Internet-connected smart grid, also\ncalled energy Internet, is also emerging as an innovative approach to ensure\nthe energy from anywhere at any time. The ultimate goal of these developments\nis to build a sustainable society. However, integrating and coordinating a\nlarge number of growing connections can be a challenging issue for the\ntraditional centralized grid system. Consequently, the smart grid is undergoing\na transformation to the decentralized topology from its centralized form. On\nthe other hand, blockchain has some excellent features which make it a\npromising application for smart grid paradigm. In this paper, we aim to provide\na comprehensive survey on application of blockchain in smart grid. As such, we\nidentify the significant security challenges of smart grid scenarios that can\nbe addressed by blockchain. Then, we present a number of blockchain-based\nrecent research works presented in different literatures addressing security\nissues in the area of smart grid.

    "title": "Discriminatory Price Mechanism for Smart Grid",
    "abstract": "We consider a scenario where a retailer can set different prices for\ndifferent consumers in a smart grid. The retailer's objective is to maximize\nthe revenue, minimize the operating cost, and maximize the consumer's welfare.\nThe retailer wants to optimize a convex combination of the above objectives\nusing price signals specific to each consumer. However, variability in unit\nprices across consumers is bounded by a parameter $\\eta$, hence limiting the\ndiscrimination. We formulate the pricing problem as a Stackelberg game where\nthe retailer is the leader and consumers are followers. Since the retailer's\noptimization problem turns out to be non-convex, we convexify it via\nrelaxations. We provide performance guarantees for the relaxations in the\nasymptotic sense (when number of consumers tends to $\\infty$). Further, we show\nthat despite the variability in pricing, the pricing scheme proposed by our\nmodel is fair as higher prices are charged to consumers who have higher\nwillingness for demand. We extend our analysis to the scenario where consumers\ncan feed energy back to the grid via net-metering. We show that our pricing\npolicy promotes fairness even in this scenario as prosumers who contribute more\nto the grid, are given large cuts on buying rates. The policy is also found to\nincentivize more prosumers to invest in renewable energy, thus encouraging\nsustainability.",

    "abstract": "Critical infrastructure systems like power grid require an improved critical\nin-formation infrastructure (CII) that can not only help in monitoring of the\ncrit-ical entities but also take part in failure analysis and self-healing.\nEfficient designing of a CII is challenging as each kind of communication\ntechnology has its own advantages and disadvantages. Wired networks are highly\nscala-ble and secure, but they are neither cost effective nor dynamic in\nnature. Wireless communication technologies on the other hand are easy to\ndeploy, low cost etc. but they are vulnerable to cyber-attacks. In order to\noptimize cost, power consumption, dynamic nature, accuracy and scalability a\nhybrid communication network is designed in this paper where a portion of the\ncommunication network is built using wireless sensor networks (WSN) and the\nrest is a wired network of fiber optic channels. To offer seamless opera-tion\nof the hybrid communication network and provide security a Secure Smart Grid\nMonitoring Technique (SSGMT) is also proposed. The perfor-mance of the proposed\nhybrid CII for the generation and transmission sys-tem of power grid coupled\nwith the SSGMT during different cyber-attacks is tested using NS2 simulator.\nThe simulation results show that the SSGMT for a joint power communication\nnetwork of IEEE 118-Bus system performs better than the prevailing wireless\nCIIs like Lo-ADI and Modified AODV.",

    "abstract": "Smart grid can be considered as the next step in the evolution of power\nsystems. It comprises of different entities and objects ranging from smart\nappliances, smart meters, generators, smart storages, and more. One key problem\nin modeling smart grid is that while currently there is a considerable focus on\nthe practical aspects of smart grid, there are very few modeling attempts and\neven lesser attempts at formalization. To the best of our knowledge, among\nother formal methods, formal specification has previously not been applied in\nthe domain of smart grid. In this paper, we attempt to bridge this gap by\npresenting a novel approach to modeling smart grid components using a formal\nspecification approach. We use a state-based formal specification language\nnamely Z (pronounced as `Zed') since we believe Z is particularly suited for\nmodeling smart grid components.We demonstrate the application of Z on key smart\ngrid components. The presented formal specification can be considered as first\nsteps towards modeling of smart grid using a Software Engineering formalism. It\nalso demonstrates how complex systems, such as the smart grid, can be modeled\nelegantly using formal specification.",

    "abstract": "Fine-grained energy usage data collected by Smart Meters (SM) is one of the\nkey components of the smart grid (SG). While collection of this data enhances\nefficiency and flexibility of SG, it also poses a serious threat to the privacy\nof consumers. Through techniques such as nonintrusive appliance load monitoring\n(NALM), this data can be used to identify the appliances being used, and hence\ndisclose the private life of the consumer. Various methods have been proposed\nin the literature to preserve the consumer privacy. This paper focuses on load\nshaping (LS) methods, which alters the consumption data by means of household\namenities in order to ensure privacy. An overview of the privacy protection\ntechniques, as well as heuristics of the LS methods, privacy measures, and\nhousehold amenities used for privacy protection are presented in order to\nthoroughly analyze the effectiveness and applicability of these methods to\nsmart grid systems. Finally, possible research directions related to privacy\nprotection in smart grids are discussed.",

    "abstract": "A reliable decision making by the operator in a smart grid is contingent upon\ncorrect analysis of intra-and-interdependencies between its entities and also\non accurate identification of the most critical entities at a given point of\ntime. A measurement based self-updating contingency list can provide real-time\ninformation to the operator about current system condition which can help the\noperator to take the required action. In this paper, the underlying\nintra-and-interdependencies between entities for a given power-communication\nnetwork is captured using a dependency model called Modified Implicative\nInterdependency Model (MIIM) [1]. Given an integer K, the event-driven\nself-updating contingency list problem gives the list of K-most critical\nentities, failure of which maximizes the network damage at the current time.\nOwing to the problem being NP complete, a fast heuristic method to generate a\nreal-time contingency list using system measurements is provided here. The\nvalidation of the work is done by comparing the contingency list obtained for\ndifferent K values using the MIIM model on a smart grid of IEEE 14-Bus system\nwith that obtained by simulating the smart grid using a co-simulation system\nformed by MATPOWER and Java Network Simulator (JNS). The results also indicate\nthat the network damage predicted by both the ILP based solution [2] and the\nproposed heuristic solution using MIIM are more realistic compared to that\nobtained using another dependency model called Implicative Interdependency\nModel (IIM) [3].",

    "title": "A Probabilistic Approach to Adaptive Protection in the Smart Grid",
    "abstract": "Smart grids are critical cyber-physical systems that are vital to our energy\nfuture. Smart grids' fault resilience is dependent on the use of advanced\nprotection systems that can reliably adapt to changing conditions within the\ngrid. The vast amount of operational data generated and collected in smart\ngrids can be used to develop these protection systems. However, given the\nsafety-criticality of protection, the algorithms used to analyze this data must\nbe stable, transparent, and easily interpretable to ensure the reliability of\nthe protection decisions. Additionally, the protection decisions must be fast,\nselective, simple, and reliable. To address these challenges, this paper\nproposes a data-driven protection strategy, based on Gaussian Discriminant\nAnalysis, for fault detection and isolation. This strategy minimizes the\ncommunication requirements for time-inverse relays, facilitates their\ncoordination, and optimizes their settings. The interpretability of the\nprotection decisions is a key focus of this paper. The method is demonstrated\nby showing how it can protect the medium-voltage CIGRE network as it\ntransitions between islanded and grid-connected modes, and radial and mesh\ntopologies.",

    "title": "Cost-Oriented Load Forecasting",
    "abstract": "Accurate load prediction is an effective way to reduce power system operation\ncosts. Traditionally, the mean square error (MSE) is a common-used loss\nfunction to guide the training of an accurate load forecasting model. However,\nthe MSE loss function is unable to precisely reflect the real costs associated\nwith forecasting errors because the cost caused by forecasting errors in the\nreal power system is probably neither symmetric nor quadratic. To tackle this\nissue, this paper proposes a generalized cost-oriented load forecasting\nframework. Specifically, how to obtain a differentiable loss function that\nreflects real cost and how to integrate the loss function with regression\nmodels are studied. The economy and effectiveness of the proposed load\nforecasting method are verified by the case studies of an optimal dispatch\nproblem that is built on the IEEE 30-bus system and the open load dataset from\nthe Global Energy Forecasting Competition 2012 (GEFCom2012).",

However, the mainstream approach, multi-step\nprediction, must be improved by cumulative errors and latency issues, which\nlimits its effectiveness in probabilistic day-ahead load forecasting (PDALF).\nTo overcome these challenges, we introduce DALNet, a novel denoising diffusion\nmodel designed to generate load curves rather than relying on direct\nprediction. By shifting the focus to curve generation, DALNet captures the\ncomplex distribution of actual load time-series data under specific conditions\nwith greater fidelity. To further enhance DALNet, we propose the temporal\nmulti-scale attention block (TMSAB), a mechanism designed to integrate both\npositional and temporal information for improved forecasting precision.\nFurthermore, we utilize kernel density estimation (KDE) to reconstruct the\ndistribution of generated load curves and employ KL divergence to compare them\nwith the actual data distribution.

In this paper, we study the vulnerability of a class of\nload forecasting algorithms and analyze the potential impact on the power\nsystem operations, such as load shedding and increased dispatch costs.\nSpecifically, we propose data injection attack algorithms that require minimal\nassumptions on the ability of the adversary. The attacker does not need to have\nknowledge about the load forecasting model or the underlying power system.\nSurprisingly, our results indicate that standard load forecasting algorithms\nare quite vulnerable to the designed black-box attacks.

    "abstract": "With high levels of intermittent power generation and dynamic demand\npatterns, accurate forecasts for residential loads have become essential. Smart\nmeters can play an important role when making these forecasts as they provide\ndetailed load data. However, using smart meter data for load forecasting is\nchallenging due to data privacy requirements. This paper investigates how these\nrequirements can be addressed through a combination of federated learning and\nprivacy preserving techniques such as differential privacy and secure\naggregation. For our analysis, we employ a large set of residential load data\nand simulate how different federated learning models and privacy preserving\ntechniques affect performance and privacy. Our simulations reveal that\ncombining federated learning and privacy preserving techniques can secure both\nhigh forecasting accuracy and near-complete privacy. Specifically, we find that\nsuch combinations enable a high level of information sharing while ensuring\nprivacy of both the processed load data and forecasting models. Moreover, we\nidentify and discuss challenges of applying federated learning, differential\nprivacy and secure aggregation for residential short-term load forecasting.",

    "abstract": "Data privacy and security have become a non-negligible factor in load\nforecasting. Previous researches mainly focus on training stage enhancement.\nHowever, once the model is trained and deployed, it may need to `forget' (i.e.,\nremove the impact of) part of training data if the these data are found to be\nmalicious or as requested by the data owner. This paper introduces the concept\nof machine unlearning which is specifically designed to remove the influence of\npart of the dataset on an already trained forecaster. However, direct\nunlearning inevitably degrades the model generalization ability. To balance\nbetween unlearning completeness and model performance, a performance-aware\nalgorithm is proposed by evaluating the sensitivity of local model parameter\nchange using influence function and sample re-weighting. Furthermore, we\nobserve that the statistical criterion such as mean squared error, cannot fully\nreflect the operation cost of the downstream tasks in power system. Therefore,\na task-aware machine unlearning is proposed whose objective is a trilevel\noptimization with dispatch and redispatch problems considered. We theoretically\nprove the existence of the gradient of such an objective, which is key to\nre-weighting the remaining samples. We tested the unlearning algorithms on\nlinear, CNN, and MLP-Mixer based load forecasters with a realistic load\ndataset. The simulation demonstrates the balance between unlearning\ncompleteness and operational cost. All codes can be found at\nhttps://github.com/xuwkk/task_aware_machine_unlearning.",

    "abstract": "In the realm of power systems, the increasing involvement of residential\nusers in load forecasting applications has heightened concerns about data\nprivacy. Specifically, the load data can inadvertently reveal the daily\nroutines of residential users, thereby posing a risk to their property\nsecurity. While federated learning (FL) has been employed to safeguard user\nprivacy by enabling model training without the exchange of raw data, these FL\nmodels have shown vulnerabilities to emerging attack techniques, such as Deep\nLeakage from Gradients and poisoning attacks. To counteract these, we initially\nemploy a Secure-Aggregation (SecAgg) algorithm that leverages multiparty\ncomputation cryptographic techniques to mitigate the risk of gradient leakage.\nHowever, the introduction of SecAgg necessitates the deployment of additional\nsub-center servers for executing the multiparty computation protocol, thereby\nescalating computational complexity and reducing system robustness, especially\nin scenarios where one or more sub-centers are unavailable. To address these\nchallenges, we introduce a Markovian Switching-based distributed training\nframework, the convergence of which is substantiated through rigorous\ntheoretical analysis. The Distributed Markovian Switching (DMS) topology shows\nstrong robustness towards the poisoning attacks as well. Case studies employing\nreal-world power system load data validate the efficacy of our proposed\nalgorithm.

    "abstract": "In traditional deep learning algorithms, one of the key assumptions is that\nthe data distribution remains constant during both training and deployment.\nHowever, this assumption becomes problematic when faced with\nOut-of-Distribution periods, such as the COVID-19 lockdowns, where the data\ndistribution significantly deviates from what the model has seen during\ntraining. This paper employs a two-fold strategy: utilizing continual learning\ntechniques to update models with new data and harnessing human mobility data\ncollected from privacy-preserving pedestrian counters located outside\nbuildings. In contrast to online learning, which suffers from 'catastrophic\nforgetting' as newly acquired knowledge often erases prior information,\ncontinual learning offers a holistic approach by preserving past insights while\nintegrating new data. This research applies FSNet, a powerful continual\nlearning algorithm, to real-world data from 13 building complexes in Melbourne,\nAustralia, a city which had the second longest total lockdown duration globally\nduring the pandemic. Results underscore the crucial role of continual learning\nin accurate energy forecasting, particularly during Out-of-Distribution\nperiods. Secondary data such as mobility and temperature provided ancillary\nsupport to the primary forecasting model. More importantly, while traditional\nmethods struggled to adapt during lockdowns, models featuring at least online\nlearning demonstrated resilience, with lockdown periods posing fewer challenges\nonce armed with adaptive learning techniques. This study contributes valuable\nmethodologies and insights to the ongoing effort to improve energy load\nforecasting during future Out-of-Distribution periods.",

    "title": "A General Framework for Load Forecasting based on Pre-trained Large Language Model",
    "abstract": "Accurate load forecasting is crucial for maintaining the power balance\nbetween generators and consumers,particularly with the increasing integration\nof renewable energy sources, which introduce significant intermittent\nvolatility. With the advancement of data-driven methods, machine learning and\ndeep learning models have become the predominant approaches for load\nforecasting tasks. In recent years, pre-trained large language models (LLMs)\nhave achieved significant progress, demonstrating superior performance across\nvarious fields. This paper proposes a load forecasting method based on LLMs,\noffering not only precise predictive capabilities but also broad and flexible\napplicability. Additionally, a data modeling method is introduced to\neffectively transform load sequence data into natural language suitable for LLM\ntraining. Furthermore, a data enhancement strategy is designed to mitigate the\nimpact of LLM hallucinations on forecasting results. The effectiveness of the\nproposed method is validated using two real-world datasets. Compared to\nexisting methods, our approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across\nall validation metrics.",

    "abstract": "Accurate electrical load forecasting is crucial for optimizing power system\noperations, planning, and management. As power systems become increasingly\ncomplex, traditional forecasting methods may fail to capture the intricate\npatterns and dependencies within load data. Machine learning (ML) techniques\nhave emerged as powerful alternatives, offering superior prediction accuracy\nand the ability to model non-linear and complex temporal relationships. This\nstudy presents a comprehensive comparison of prominent ML models: feedforward\nneural networks, recurrent neural networks, long short-term memory networks,\ngated recurrent units, and the attention temporal graph convolutional network;\nfor short-term load forecasting of the Energy Corridor distribution system in\nHouston, Texas. Using a 24-hour look-back window, we train the models on\ndatasets spanning one and five years, to predict the load demand for the next\nhour and assess performance. Our findings aim to identify the most effective ML\napproach for accurate load forecasting, contributing to improved grid\nreliability and system optimization.",

    "abstract": "Accurate electrical load forecasting is of great importance for the efficient\noperation and control of modern power systems. In this work, a hybrid long\nshort-term memory (LSTM)-based model with online correction is developed for\nday-ahead electrical load forecasting. Firstly, four types of features are\nextracted from the original electrical load dataset, including the historical\ntime series, time index features, historical statistical features, and\nsimilarity features. Then, a hybrid LSTM-based electrical load forecasting\nmodel is designed, where an LSTM neural network block and a fully-connected\nneural network block are integrated that can model both temporal features\n(historical time series) and non-temporal features (the rest features). A\ngradient regularization-based offline training algorithm and an output layer\nparameter fine-tuning-based online model correction method are developed to\nenhance the model's capabilities to defend against disturbance and adapt to the\nlatest load data distribution, thus improving the forecasting accuracy. At\nlast, extensive experiments are carried out to validate the effectiveness of\nthe proposed electrical load forecasting strategy with superior accuracy\ncompared with commonly used forecasting models.",

    "abstract": "Fast and reliable transmission network reconfiguration is critical in\nimproving power grid resilience to cyber-attacks. If the network\nreconfiguration following cyber-attacks is imperfect, secondary incidents may\ndelay or interrupt post-attack restoration of the power grid. This paper\nproposes a framework of resilient transmission network reconfiguration, taking\ninto account the impacts of cyber-attacks in the network reconfiguration\nprocess. First, the mechanism of cyber-attack propagation is analyzed based on\nthe characteristics of network reconfiguration. Second, systematic resilience\nindices are specially extracted in which the impact of cyber-attacks on network\nreconfiguration is quantified. These indices are defined in terms of the\nrestoration characteristics of the transmission power system. Third,\nrepresentative cyber-attack incidents motivate an optimization-based model of\nresilient transmission network reconfiguration, and an optimal reconstruction\nscheme is obtained. Finally, simulation results based on the IEEE 39-bus system\nverify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed framework in enhancing\npower grid resilience to cyber-attacks.",

    "abstract": "The Ireland and Northern Ireland power system is in a period of rapid\ntransition from conventional generation to renewable generation and has seen a\nrapid increase in large demand sites requiring connection into the backbone\ntransmission system. The role of EirGrid and SONI as Transmission System\nOperator in Ireland and Northern Ireland is to operate, maintain and develop\nthe electricity transmission network. EirGrid ensures that new transmission\nprojects are developed in a way that balances technical, economic, community\nand other stakeholder considerations. This has resulted in much more detailed\nevaluation of planning options to maximize utilisation of the existing network\nwhich may include but are not limited to uprating the capacity of the existing\ntransmission system mainly through the thermal or voltage uprate of existing\ncircuits. Another method to increase network utilisation is to strategically\ndeploy Power Flow Control devices to relieve system overloads and maximise\nnetwork transfer capacities. EirGrid has developed a new grid development\nstrategy that places particular emphasis on identifying technologies to help\nresolve network issues. This paper presents the study findings for the\napplication of a power flow controller (PFC) to relieve system issues.",

    "abstract": "The transmission system operators (TSOs) are responsible to provide secure\nand efficient access to the transmission system for all stakeholders. This task\nis gradually getting challenging due to the demand growth, demand uncertainty,\nrapid changes in generation mix, and market policies. Traditionally, the TSOs\ntry to maximize the technical performance of the transmission network via\nbuilding new overhead lines or physical hardening. However, obtaining public\nacceptance for building new lines is not an easy step in this procedure. For\nthis reason, the TSOs try to capture the capabilities of existing assets. This\npaper investigates the use of modular FACTS devices (to alter the line\ncharacteristics) for improving the capability of transmission network in\nserving the uncertain demand without the need for building new overhead lines.\nThe proposed method considers the uncertainty of demands and controls the\nutilization of existing transmission assets.

    "abstract": "Due to the evolving nature of power systems and the complicated coupling\nrelationship of power devices, it has been a great challenge to identify the\ncontingencies that could trigger cascading blackouts of power systems. This\npaper provides an effective approach to identifying the initial contingency in\npower transmission networks, which are equipped with flexible alternating\ncurrent transmission system (FACTS) devices, high-voltage direct current (HVDC)\nlinks and protective relays. Essentially, the problem of contingency\nidentification is formulated in the framework of nonlinear programming, which\ncan be solved by the Jacobian-Free Newton-Krylov (JFNK) method to circumvent\nthe Jacobian matrix and reduce the computational cost. Notably, the proposed\nidentification approach is also applied to complicated cascading failure models\nof power systems. Finally, numerical simulations are carried out to validate\nthe proposed identification approach on IEEE 118 Bus Systems.

We here\nidentify the key parameters of the COVID-19 transmission network for time\nperiods before, during, and after the application of strict NPIs for the first\nwave of COVID-19 infections in Germany combining Bayesian parameter inference\nwith an agent-based epidemiological model. We assume a Watts-Strogatz\nsmall-world network which allows to distinguish contacts within clustered\ncliques and unclustered, random contacts in the population, which have been\nshown to be crucial in sustaining the epidemic. In contrast to other works,\nwhich use coarse-grained network structures from anonymized data, like cell\nphone data, we consider the contacts of individual agents explicitly. We show\nthat NPIs drastically reduced random contacts in the transmission network,\nincreased network clustering, and resulted in a change from an exponential to a\nconstant regime of newcases. In this regime, the disease spreads like a wave\nwith a finite wave speed that depends on the number of contacts in a nonlinear\nfashion, which we can predict by mean field theory. Our analysis indicates that\nbesides the well-known transitionbetween exponential increase and exponential\ndecrease in the number of new cases, NPIs can induce a transition to another,\npreviously unappreciated regime of constant new cases.",

    "abstract": "It is crucial for maintaining the security of supply that transmission\nnetworks continue to operate even if a single line fails. Modeling $\\mathcal{N}\n- 1$ security in power system capacity expansion problems introduces many extra\nconstraints if all possible outages are accounted for, which leads to a high\ncomputational burden. Typical approaches to avoid this burden consider only a\nsubset of possible outages relevant to a given dispatch situation. However,\nthis relies on knowing the dispatch situation beforehand, and it is not\nsuitable for investment optimization problems where the generation fleet is not\nknown in advance. In this paper, we introduce a heuristic approach to model the\nfully secured $\\mathcal{N}-1$ feasible space using a smaller number of\nconstraints in a way that only depends on the topology of transmission\nnetworks. In our proposed approach, the network's security is modelled by\ncomparing the polytope of the feasible space of nodal net power obtained from\nthe security-constrained linearized AC optimal power flow problem. To\napproximate this polytope, a buffer capacity factor is defined for transmission\nlines in the $\\mathcal{N}-0$ secure case, thereby avoiding the introduction of\nmany additional constraints. In this way, three approaches are introduced for\nobtaining a buffer capacity factor consisting of approximate, robust and\nline-specific approaches. Finally, the performance of our proposed approaches\nis assessed in different scales of transmission networks for determining the\nproposed buffer capacity factors, contingency analysis and economic evaluation.\nMoreover, we find that our proposed heuristics provide excellent approximations\nof the fully secured $\\mathcal{N}-1$ solutions with a much lower computational\nburden.",

To gain the systems level understanding of the role of global\ntransmission routes in the COVID-19 spread, in this study, we have developed\nthe first, empirical, global, index-case transmission network of SARS-CoV-2\ntermed as C19-TraNet. We manually curated the travel history of country wise\nindex-cases using government press releases, their official social media\nhandles and online news reports to construct this C19-TraNet that is a\nspatio-temporal, sparse, growing network comprising of 187 nodes and 199 edges\nand follows a power-law degree distribution. To model the growing C19-TraNet, a\nnovel stochastic scale free (SSF) algorithm is proposed that accounts for\nstochastic addition of both nodes as well as edges at each time step. A\npeculiar connectivity pattern in C19-TraNet is observed, characterized by a\nfourth degree polynomial growth curve, that significantly diverges from the\naverage random connectivity pattern obtained from an ensemble of its 1,000 SSF\nrealizations. Partitioning the C19-TraNet, using edge betweenness, it is found\nthat most of the large communities are comprised of a heterogeneous mixture of\ncountries belonging to different world regions suggesting that there are no\nspatial constraints on the spread of disease.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a distributed framework for vehicle grid integration\n(VGI) taking into account the communication and physical networks. To this end,\nwe model the electric vehicle (EV) behaviour that includes time of departure,\ntime of arrival, state of charge, required energy, and its objectives, e.g.,\navoid battery degradation. Next, we formulate the centralised day ahead\ndistribution market (DADM) which explicitly represents the physical system,\nsupports unbalanced three phase networks with delta and wye connections, and\nincorporates the charging needs of EVs. The solution of the centralised market\nrequires knowledge of EV information in terms of desired energy, departure and\narrival times that EV owners are reluctant in providing. Moreover, the\ncomputational effort required to solve the DADM in cases of numerous EVs is\nvery intensive. As such, we propose a distributed solution of the DADM clearing\nmechanism over a time-varying communication network. We illustrate the proposed\nVGI framework through the 13-bus, 33- bus, and 141-bus distribution feeders.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a hydraulic model based on the Euler turbine equations\nsuitable for the purpose of grid integration studies of variable speed\nhydropower (VSHP). The work was motivated by the need to assess how the dynamic\nperformance might change when a hydropower plant is operated at variable speed.\nThe Euler model considers the water flow dependency on the turbine rotational\nspeed and calculates the turbine power as a non-linear function of water flow,\nturbine rotational speed and guide vane opening. A waterway model is included,\nbased on the 1-D momentum and continuity balance for a water-filled elementary\npipe to simulate water hammer, mass oscillation and tunnel losses. These\ndetailed and accurate models are necessary for recognising possible limitations\nin the hydraulic system, to model the turbine power and rotational speed\ncorrectly and thereby to be able to maximise power delivery for system control\npurposes. All Euler model parameters can be derived from the physical\ndimensions of the turbine and waterway, ensuring easy implementation.\nState-space representation of the Euler model is approximated by utilising a\nlumped-parameter equivalent of the penstock dynamics. Dynamic simulations and\neigenvalue analysis show the strength of the Euler model compared to\nconventional hydropower models.",

Type-5 wind turbine\ngeneration has the potential to behave like a traditional synchronous generator\nand can help improve system inertia. Hydraulic torque converter (TC) and\ngearbox with torque limiting feature are integral parts of a Type-5 wind\nturbine unit. High fidelity model of Type-5 wind turbine including these core\ncomponents is not openly and widely available for grid integration and\ntransient stability studies. This hinders appropriate assessment of Type-5 wind\npower plant's contribution to bulk grid resilience. This work develops a TC\nmodel based on those generally used in automobile's transmission system.\nMoreover, the concept of torsional coupling is leveraged to integrate the TC\nand gearbox system dynamics. The entire integrated model will be open sourced\nand publicly available for grid integration studies.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the economic impact of vehicle-home-grid integration,\nby proposing an online energy management algorithm that optimizes energy flows\nbetween an electric vehicle (EV), a household, and the electrical grid. The\nalgorithm leverages vehicle-to-home (V2H) for self-consumption and\nvehicle-to-grid (V2G) for energy trading, adapting to real-time conditions\nthrough a hybrid long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network for accurate\nhousehold load prediction, alongside a comprehensive nonlinear battery\ndegradation model accounting for both cycle and calendar aging. Simulation\nresults reveal significant economic advantages: compared to smart\nunidirectional charging, the proposed method yields an annual economic benefit\nof up to EUR 3046.81, despite a modest 1.96% increase in battery degradation.\nEven under unfavorable market conditions, where V2G energy selling generates no\nrevenue, V2H alone ensures yearly savings of EUR 425.48. A systematic\nsensitivity analysis investigates how variations in battery capacity, household\nload, and price ratios affect economic outcomes, confirming the consistent\nbenefits of bidirectional energy exchange. These findings highlight the\npotential of EVs as active energy nodes, enabling sustainable energy management\nand cost-effective battery usage in real-world conditions.",

    "abstract": "Offshore wind farms (OWFs) are set to significantly contribute to global\ndecarbonization efforts. Developers often use a sequential approach to optimize\ndesign variables and market participation for grid-integrated offshore wind\nfarms. However, this method can lead to sub-optimal system performance, and\nuncertainties associated with renewable resources are often overlooked in\ndecision-making. This paper proposes a control co-design approach, optimizing\ndesign and control decisions for integrating OWFs into the power grid while\nconsidering energy market and primary frequency market participation.\nAdditionally, we introduce optimal sizing solutions for energy storage systems\ndeployed onshore to enhance revenue for OWF developers over time. This\nframework addresses uncertainties related to wind resources and energy prices.\nWe analyze five U.S. west-coast offshore wind farm locations and potential\ninterconnection points, as identified by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management\n(BOEM). Results show that optimized control co-design solutions can increase\nmarket revenue by 3.2\\% and provide flexibility in managing wind resource\nuncertainties.",

    "abstract": "Synchrophasor technology is an emerging and developing technology for\nmonitoring and control of wide area measurement systems (WAMS). In an\nelementary WAMS, two identical phasors measured at two different locations have\ndifference in the phase angles measured since their reference waveforms are not\nsynchronized with each other. Phasor measurement units (PMUs) measure input\nphasors with respect to a common reference wave based on the atomic clock\npulses received from global positioning system (GPS) satellites, eliminating\nvariation in the measured phase angles due to distant locations of the\nmeasurement nodes. This has found tremendous applications in quick fault\ndetection, fault location analysis, accurate current, voltage, frequency and\nphase angle measurements in WAMS. Commercially available PMU models are often\nproven to be expensive for research and development as well as for grid\nintegration projects. This research article proposes an economic PMU model\noptimized for accurate steadystate performance based on recursive discrete\nFourier transform (DFT) and provides results and detailed analysis of the\nproposed PMU model as per the steady state compliance specifications of IEEE\nstandard C37.118.1. Results accurate up to 13 digits after decimal point are\nobtained through the developed PMU model for both nominal and off-nominal\nfrequency inputs in steady state.",

    "abstract": "Managing supply and demand in the electricity grid is becoming more\nchallenging due to the increasing penetration of variable renewable energy\nsources. As significant end-use consumers, and through better grid integration,\nbuildings are expected to play an expanding role in the future smart grid.\nPredictive control allows buildings to better harness available energy\nflexibility from the building passive thermal mass. However, due to the\nheterogeneous nature of the building stock, developing computationally\ntractable control-oriented models, which adequately represent the complex and\nnonlinear thermal-dynamics of individual buildings, is proving to be a major\nhurdle. Data-driven predictive control, coupled with the \"Internet of Things\",\nholds the promise for a scalable and transferrable approach,with data-driven\nmodels replacing traditional physics-based models. This review examines recent\nwork utilising data-driven predictive control for demand side management\napplication with a special focus on the nexus of model development and control\nintegration, which to date, previous reviews have not addressed. Further topics\nexamined include the practical requirements for harnessing passive thermal mass\nand the issue of feature selection.

    "abstract": "Electric vehicles (EVs) are finally making their way onto the roads, but the\nchallenges concerning long charging times and impact on congestion of the power\ndistribution grid are still not resolved. Proposed solutions depend on heavy\ncommunication and rigorous computation and mostly need real-time connectivity\nfor optimal operation; thereby, they are not scalable. With the availability of\nhistorical measurement data, EV chargers can take better-informed actions while\nstaying mostly off-line. This study develops a distributed and data-driven\ncongestion detection methodology together with the Additive Increase\nMultiplicative Decrease (AIMD) algorithm to control mass EV charging in a\ndistribution grid. The proposed distributed AIMD algorithm performs very\nclosely to the ideal AIMD in terms of fairness and congestion handling, and its\ncommunication need is significantly low.

The power generation system is based on\ndistributed energy resources (DERs) interfaced with either grid-forming (GFM)\nor grid-following (GFL) inverters. The secondary controller is based on online\nfeedback optimization leveraging the learned sensitivities of the changes in\nthe system frequency, voltage magnitudes at critical buses, and active power\nflows through critical lines to the changes in inverter active and reactive\npower setpoints. To learn the sensitivities accurately from data, the feedback\noptimization has a built-in mechanism for keeping the secondary control inputs\npersistently exciting without degrading its performance. The feedback\noptimization also utilizes the learned power-voltage characteristics of\nphotovoltaic (PV) arrays to compute DC-link voltage setpoints so as to allow\nthe PV arrays to track the power setpoints. To learn the power-voltage\ncharacteristics, we separately execute a data-driven approach that fits a\nconcave polynomial to the collected power-voltage measurements by solving a\nsum-of-squares (SoS) optimization.

    "abstract": "We focus on the aggregation of distributed energy resources (DERs) through a\nprofit-maximizing intermediary that enables participation of DERs in wholesale\nelectricity markets. Particularly, we study the market efficiency brought in by\nthe large-scale deployment of DERs and explore to what extent such benefits are\noffset by the profit-maximizing nature of the aggregator. We deploy a\ngame-theoretic framework to study the strategic interactions between an\naggregator and DER owners. The proposed model takes into account the stochastic\nnature of the DER supply. We explicitly characterize the equilibrium of the\ngame and provide illustrative examples to quantify the efficiency loss due to\nthe strategic incentives of the aggregator. Our numerical experiments\nillustrate the impact of uncertainty and amount of DER integration on the\noverall market efficiency.",

    "title": "Aggregating Privacy-Conscious Distributed Energy Resources for Grid Service Provision",
    "abstract": "The increasing adoption of advanced metering infrastructure has led to\ngrowing concerns regarding privacy risks stemming from the high resolution\nmeasurements. This has given rise to privacy protection techniques that\nphysically alter the consumer's energy load profile, masking private\ninformation by using localised devices, e.g. batteries or flexible loads.\nMeanwhile, there has also been increasing interest in aggregating the\ndistributed energy resources (DERs) of residential consumers to provide\nservices to the grid. In this paper, we propose an online distributed algorithm\nto aggregate the DERs of privacy-conscious consumers to provide services to the\ngrid, whilst preserving their privacy. Results show that the optimisation\nsolution from the distributed method converges to one close to the optimum\ncomputed using an ideal centralised solution method, balancing between grid\nservice provision, consumer preferences and privacy protection. More\nimportantly, the distributed method preserves consumer privacy, and does not\nrequire high-bandwidth two-way communications infrastructure.",

    "abstract": "The fast growth of distributed energy resources (DERs), such as distributed\nrenewables (e.g., rooftop PV panels), energy storage systems, electric\nvehicles, and controllable appliances, drives the power system toward a\ndecentralized system with bidirectional power flow. The coordination of DERs\nthrough an aggregator, such as a utility, system operator, or a third-party\ncoordinator, emerges as a promising paradigm. However, it is not well\nunderstood how to enable trust between the aggregator and DERs to integrate\nDERs efficiently. In this paper, we develop a trustable and distributed\ncoordination system for DERs using blockchain technology. We model various DERs\nand formulate a cost minimization problem for DERs to optimize their energy\ntrading, scheduling, and demand response. We use the alternating direction\nmethod of multipliers (ADMM) to solve the problem in a distributed fashion. To\nimplement the distributed algorithm in a trustable way, we design a smart\ncontract to update multipliers and communicate with DERs in a blockchain\nnetwork. We validate our design by experiments using real-world data, and the\nsimulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm.",

    "abstract": "In smart grids, distributed energy resources (DERs) have penetrated\nresidential zones to provide a new form of electricity supply, mainly from\nrenewable energy. Residential households and commercial buildings with DERs\nhave become prosumers in the local grids, since they can sell surplus power to\nothers. Researches have been initiated to integrate and utilize DERs through\nbetter control and communication strategies. With the advances in the Internet\nof Things (IoT) technology, unprecedented coordination among DERs can be\nachieved to facilitate energy trading and transactive energy management.\nHowever, preventing leakage of users' information during the optimization\nprocess keeps challenging researchers, which drives them to develop\nprivacy-preserving energy management systems. In this paper, we develop a fully\ndecentralized transactive energy management using the consensus-based\nalgorithm. To be specific, we design a virtual pool for prosumers to trade\nenergy and exchange information with IoT technologies' support. The\nconsensus-based algorithm enables prosumers to obtain the optimal energy\nschedule independently in a coordinated manner without revealing any personal\ndata. We use real-world data to perform simulations and validate our developed\nalgorithm. The results show that our consensus-based decentralized transactive\nenergy management strategy is feasible and can significantly reduce the overall\nsystem cost.",

    "abstract": "The digitization and decentralization of the electric power grid are key\nthrusts for an economically and environmentally sustainable future. Towards\nthis goal, distributed energy resources (DER), including rooftop solar panels,\nbattery storage, electric vehicles, etc., are becoming ubiquitous in power\nsystems. Power utilities benefit from DERs as they minimize operational costs;\nat the same time, DERs grant users and aggregators control over the power they\nproduce and consume. DERs are interconnected, interoperable, and support\nremotely controllable features, thus, their cybersecurity is of cardinal\nimportance. DER communication dependencies and the diversity of DER\narchitectures widen the threat surface and aggravate the cybersecurity posture\nof power systems. In this work, we focus on security oversights that reside in\nthe cyber and physical layers of DERs and can jeopardize grid operations.\nExisting works have underlined the impact of cyberattacks targeting DER assets,\nhowever, they either focus on specific system components (e.g., communication\nprotocols), do not consider the mission-critical objectives of DERs, or neglect\nthe adversarial perspective (e.g., adversary/attack models) altogether. To\naddress these omissions, we comprehensively analyze adversarial capabilities\nand objectives when manipulating DER assets, and then present how protocol and\ndevice-level vulnerabilities can materialize into cyberattacks impacting power\nsystem operations. Finally, we provide mitigation strategies to thwart\nadversaries and directions for future DER cybersecurity research.",

A key feature of this reduced-order model is that its parameters\ncan be related to those of the originating higher-order dynamical model.

Time-domain simulations validate the accuracy of the\nmodel-reduction method and demonstrate how DER controllers can be designed to\nmeet steady-state-regulation and transient-performance specifications.",

    "abstract": "With increasing availability of communication and control infrastructure at\nthe distribution systems, it is expected that the distributed energy resources\n(DERs) will take an active part in future power systems operations. One of the\nmain challenges associated with integration of DERs in grid planning and\ncontrol is in estimating the available flexibility in a collection of\n(heterogeneous) DERs, each of which may have local constraints that vary over\ntime. In this work, we present a geometric approach for approximating the\nflexibility of a DER in modulating its active and reactive power consumption.\nThe proposed method is agnostic about the type and model of the DERs, thereby\nfacilitating a plug-and-play approach, and allows scalable aggregation of the\nflexibility of a collection of (heterogeneous) DERs at the distributed system\nlevel.

    "abstract": "Grid supportive (GS) modes integrated within distributed energy resources\n(DERs) can improve the frequency response. However, synthesis of GS modes for\nguaranteed performance is challenging. Moreover, a tool is needed to handle\nsophisticated specifications from grid codes and protection relays. This paper\nproposes a model predictive control (MPC)-based mode synthesis methodology,\nwhich can accommodate the temporal logic specifications (TLSs). The TLSs allow\nricher descriptions of control specifications addressing both magnitude and\ntime at the same time. The proposed controller will compute a series of Boolean\ncontrol signals to synthesize the GS mode of DERs by solving the MPC problem\nunder the normal condition, where the frequency response predicted by a\nreduced-order model satisfies the defined specifications. Once a sizable\ndisturbance is detected, the pre-calculated signals are applied to the DERs.\nThe proposed synthesis methodology is verified on the full nonlinear model in\nSimulink. A robust factor is imposed on the specifications to compensate the\nresponse mismatch between the reduce-order model and nonlinear model so that\nthe nonlinear response satisfies the required TLS.",

This paper presents a novel, versatile, and transferable approach\ncombining model-based optimization with a convolutional long short-term memory\nnetwork for energy storage to respond to or bid into wholesale electricity\nmarkets. We test our proposed approach using historical prices from New York\nState, showing it achieves state-of-the-art results, achieving between 70% to\nnear 90% profit ratio compared to perfect foresight cases, in both price\nresponse and wholesale market bidding setting with various energy storage\ndurations.

    "abstract": "This paper introduces and rationalizes a new model for bidding and clearing\nenergy storage resources in wholesale energy markets. Charge and discharge bids\nin this model depend on the storage state-of-charge (SoC). In this setting,\nstorage participants submit different bids for each SoC segment. The system\noperator monitors the storage SoC and updates their bids accordingly in market\nclearings. Combined with an optimal bidding design algorithm using dynamic\nprogramming, our paper shows that the SoC segment market model provides more\naccurate representations of the opportunity costs of energy storage compared to\nexisting power-based bidding models. The new model also captures the inherent\nSoC-dependent operational characteristics of energy storage. We benchmark the\nSoC segment market model against an existing single-segment model in\nprice-taker and price-influencer simulations. The simulation results show that\ncompared to the existing power-based bidding model, the proposed model improves\nprofits by 10-56% in the price-taker case study; the model also improves total\nsystem cost reduction from storage by around 5%, and helps reduce price\nvolatilities in the price-influencer case study.",

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of how best to coordinate, or `stack,'\nenergy storage services in systems that lack centralized markets. Specifically,\nits focus is on how to coordinate transmission-level congestion relief with\nlocal, distribution-level objectives. We describe and demonstrate a unified\ncommunication and optimization framework for performing this coordination. The\ncongestion relief problem formulation employs a weighted $\\ell_{1}$-norm\nobjective. This approach determines a set of corrective actions, i.e., energy\nstorage injections and conventional generation adjustments, that minimize the\nrequired deviations from a planned schedule. To exercise this coordination\nframework, we present two case studies. The first is based on a 3-bus test\nsystem, and the second on a realistic representation of the Pacific Northwest\nregion of the United States. The results indicate that the scheduling\nmethodology provides congestion relief, cost savings, and improved renewable\nenergy integration. The large-scale case study informed the design of a live\ndemonstration carried out in partnership with the University of Washington,\nDoosan GridTech, Snohomish County PUD, and the Bonneville Power Administration.\nThe goal of the demonstration was to test the feasibility of the scheduling\nframework in a production environment with real-world energy storage assets.\nThe demonstration results were consistent with computational simulations.",

    "abstract": "Energy storage can play an important role in energy management of end users.\nTo promote an efficient utilization of energy storage, we develop a novel\nbusiness model to enable virtual storage sharing among a group of users.\nSpecifically, a storage aggregator invests and operates the central physical\nstorage unit, by virtualizing it into separable virtual capacities and selling\nto users. Each user purchases the virtual capacity, and utilize it to reduce\nthe energy cost. We formulate the interaction between the aggregator and users\nas a two-stage optimization problem. In Stage 1, over the investment horizon,\nthe aggregator determines the investment and pricing decisions. In Stage 2, in\neach operational horizon, each user decides the virtual capacity to purchase\ntogether with the operation of the virtual storage. We characterize a stepwise\nform of the optimal solution of Stage-2 Problem and a piecewise linear\nstructure of the optimal profit of Stage-1 Problem, both with respect to the\nvirtual capacity price. Based on the solution structure, we design an algorithm\nto attain the optimal solution of the two-stage problem. In our simulation\nresults, the proposed storage virtualization model can reduce the physical\nenergy storage investment of the aggregator by 54.3% and reduce the users'\ntotal costs by 34.7%, compared to the case where users acquire their own\nphysical storage.",

    "abstract": "The problem of pricing utility-scale energy storage resources (ESRs) in the\nreal-time electricity market is considered. Under a rolling-window dispatch\nmodel where the operator centrally dispatches generation and consumption under\nforecasting uncertainty, it is shown that almost all uniform pricing schemes,\nincluding the standard locational marginal pricing (LMP), result in lost\nopportunity costs that require out-of-the-market settlements. It is also shown\nthat such settlements give rise to disincentives for generating firms and\nstorage participants to bid truthfully, even when these market participants are\nrational price-takers in a competitive market. Temporal locational marginal\npricing (TLMP) is proposed for ESRs as a generalization of LMP to an in-market\ndiscriminative form. TLMP is a sum of the system-wide energy price, LMP, and\nthe individual state-of-charge price. It is shown that, under arbitrary\nforecasting errors, the rolling-window implementation of TLMP eliminates the\nlost opportunity costs and provides incentives to price-taking firms to bid\ntruthfully with their marginal costs. Numerical examples show insights into the\neffects of uniform and non-uniform pricing mechanisms on dispatch following and\ntruthful bidding incentives.",

A two-fold\noptimization framework is provided where the first optimization problem seeks\nto find the optimal storage schedule that minimizes operational costs.

Although, in general, these problems are difficult to solve, we\nprovide a lower bound on the cost savings for a parametrized family of demand\nprofiles. The optimization framework is numerically illustrated using\nreal-world demand data from ISO New England. Numerical results show that energy\nstorage can reduce energy generation costs by at least 2.5 %.",

    "title": "A Comparative Analysis of Nigeria's Power Sector with and without Grid-Scale Storage: Future Implications for Emission and Renewable Energy Integration",
    "abstract": "This research proposes a framework for modeling and comparing two electricity\nscenarios for Nigeria by 2050, focusing on the inclusion and exclusion of\nelectricity storage technologies. A Central Composite Design (CCD) was used to\ngenerate a design matrix for data collection, with EnergyPLAN software used to\ncreate energy system simulations on the CCD data for four outputs: total annual\ncost, CO2 emissions, critical excess electricity production (CEEP), and\nelectricity import. Three machine learning algorithms, support vector\nregression (SVR), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and multi-layer\nperceptron (MLP), were tuned using Bayesian optimization to develop models\nmapping the inputs to outputs. A genetic algorithm was employed for\nmulti-objective optimization to determine the optimal input capacities that\nminimize the outputs. Results indicated that incorporating electricity storage\ntechnologies (EST) leads to a 37% increase in renewable electricity sources\n(RES) share, resulting in a 19.14% reduction in CO2 emissions. EST such as\nbattery energy storage systems (BESS), pumped hydro storage (PHS), and\nvehicle-to-grid (V2G) storage allow for the storage of the critical excess\nelectricity that comes with increasing RES share. Integrating EST in Nigeria's\n2050 energy landscape is crucial for incorporating more renewable electricity\nsources into the energy system, thereby reducing CO2 emissions and managing\nexcess electricity production. This study outlines a plan for optimal\nelectricity production to meet Nigeria's 2050 demand, highlighting the need for\na balanced approach that combines fossil fuels, renewable energy, nuclear\npower, and advanced storage solutions to achieve a sustainable and efficient\nelectricity system.",

    "title": "The development of battery storage systems in Germany: A market review (status 2023)",
    "abstract": "The market for battery storage systems (BSS) has been growing rapidly for\nyears and will multiply in the future. With this extension of our previous\nworks, we contribute key figures for model parametrization and political\ndecision-making and depict the market development in Germany, one of the\nleading storage markets worldwide. In empirical analyses, we evaluate and\ncombine all major public databases on national stationary and mobile storage as\nwell as our databases from subsidy programs and extend the insights by\nliterature research and bilateral industry exchange. In comparison to 2021, the\nmarket for home storage systems (HSS) grew by 52% in terms of battery energy in\n2022 and is by far the largest stationary storage market in Germany. We\nestimate that about 220,000 HSS (1.9 GWh / 1.2 GW) were installed solely in\n2022. The emerging market for industrial storage systems (ISS) grew by 24% in\n2022, with a total of 1,200 ISS (0.08 GWh / 0.04 GW) installed. The market for\nlarge-scale storage systems (LSS) increased strongly by 910% with 47 LSS (0.47\nGWh / 0.43 GW) commissioned. The electric vehicle (EV) market grew with 693,000\nnew EV (27 GWh / 43 GW (DC) / 4.5 GW (AC)) by 34% in terms of battery energy.\nSystem BSS prices increased significantly in 2022 and were estimated at 1,200\nEUR/kWh for HSS. LSS prices ranged on average from 310 EUR/kWh to 465 EUR/kWh.\nIn total, we estimate that over 650,000 stationary BSS with a battery energy of\n7.0 GWh with an inverter power of 4.3 GW and 1,878,000 EV with a battery energy\nof 65 GWh and a DC charging power of 91 GW (12 GW AC) were operated in Germany\nby the end of 2022. The cumulative battery energy of about 72 GWh is therefore\nnearly twice the 39 GWh of nationally installed pumped hydro storage\ndemonstrating the enormous flexibility potential of battery storage for the\nenergy system.",

    "abstract": "The high dependence on imported fuels and the potential for both climate\nchange mitigation and economic diversification make Barbados' energy system\nparticularly interesting for detailed transformation analysis. An open source\nenergy system model is presented here for the analysis of a future Barbadian\nenergy system. The model was applied in a scenario analysis, using a greenfield\napproach, to investigate cost-optimal and 100% renewable energy system\nconfigurations. Within the scenarios, the electrification of private passenger\nvehicles and cruise ships through shore-to-ship power supply was modelled to\nassess its impact on the energy system and the necessary investment in storage.\nResults show that for most scenarios of a system in 2030, a renewable energy\nshare of over 80% is achieved in cost-optimal cases, even with a growing\ndemand. The system's levelised costs of electricity range from 0.17 to 0.36\nBBD/kWh in the cost-optimal scenarios and increase only moderately for 100%\nrenewable systems. Under the reasonable assumption of decreasing photovoltaic\ninvestment costs, system costs of a 100% system may be lower than the current\ncosts. The results show that pumped hydro-storage is a no-regret option for the\nBarbadian power system design. Overall, the results highlight the great\npotential of renewable energy as well as the technical and economic feasibility\nof a 100% renewable energy system for Barbados.",

    "title": "The role of storage technologies throughout the decarbonisation of the sector-coupled European energy system",
    "abstract": "We use an open, hourly-resolved, networked model of the European energy\nsystem to investigate the storage requirements under decreasing CO$_2$\nemissions targets and several sector-coupling scenarios. For the power system,\nsignificant storage capacities only emerge for CO$_2$ reductions higher than\n80% of 1990 level in that sector. For 95% CO$_2$ reductions, the optimal system\nincludes electric batteries and hydrogen storage energy capacities equivalent\nto 1.4 and 19.4 times the average hourly electricity demand. Coupling heating\nand transport sectors enables deeper global CO$_2$ reductions before the\nrequired storage capacities become significant, which highlights the importance\nof sector coupling strategies in the transition to low carbon energy systems. A\nbinary selection of storage technologies is consistently found, i.e., electric\nbatteries act as short-term storage to counterbalance solar photovoltaic\ngeneration while hydrogen storage smooths wind fluctuations. Flexibility from\nthe electric vehicle batteries provided by coupling the transport sector avoid\nthe need for additional stationary batteries and reduce the usage of pumped\nhydro storage. Coupling the heating sector brings to the system large\ncapacities of thermal energy storage to compensate for the significant seasonal\nvariation in heating demand.",

    "abstract": "The paper provides a comprehensive battery storage modelling approach, which\naccounts for operation- and degradation-aware characteristics, i.e., variable\nefficiency, internal resistance growth, and capacity fade. Based on the\navailable experimental data from the literature, we build mixed-integer linear\nprogramming compatible lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO$_4$) battery model that\ncan be used in problems related to various applications, i.e., power system,\nsmart grid, and vehicular applications. Such formulation allows finding the\nglobally optimal solution using off-the-shelf academic and commercial solvers.\nIn the numerical study, the proposed modelling approach has been applied to\nrealistic scenarios of peak-shaving, where the importance of considering the\ndeveloped models is explicitly demonstrated. For instance, a time-varying\noperation strategy is required to obtain the optimal utilization of the\nLiFePO$_4$ battery storage. Particularly, during the battery operational\nlifetime its optimal average SoC may change by up to $20\\%$, while the duration\nof charging process may increase by $75\\%$. Finally, using the same LiFePO$_4$\nbenchmark model from the literature, we compare the results of using the\nproposed approach to the state-of-the-art in the optimal sizing and scheduling\nproblems. The proposed approach led to a $12.1\\%$ reduction of battery\ninvestment and operating costs compared to the state-of-the-art method.",

A time-varying prediction of the power price and\nproduction-demand uncertainty are considered. We focus on optimizing an\neconomic objective cost while avoiding very low or very high state of charge,\nwhich can damage the battery. We consider the bounded power provided by the\nmain grid and the constraints on the power input and state of each agent. A\nparametrized MPC-scheme is used as a function approximator for the\ndeterministic policy gradient method and RL optimizes the closed-loop\nperformance by updating the parameters. Simulation results demonstrate that the\nproposed method is able to tackle the constraints and deliver the optimal\npolicy.",

    "title": "Decision making under uncertainty for deploying battery storage as a non-wire alternative in distribution networks",
    "abstract": "The growing demand for electricity in emerging markets and developing\neconomies (EMDE) such as India is causing loading and congestion problems on\ndistribution networks, particularly in urban locations, that adversely impact\nsustainable development and economic growth. Electric utilities in these\neconomies face unique constraints regarding raising capital required to upgrade\ntheir congested networks. Battery storage has emerged as a non-wire alternative\n(NWA) to feeder upgrades. This article presents a flexible valuation framework\nfor battery storage use in distribution networks and its application in the\ncontext of EMDE distribution network planning. We evaluate the value of storage\nas an NWA using a multi-stage decision making process that combines system\noptimization with markov-decision processes (MDP) to identify the least-cost\nnetwork upgrade strategy under demand growth uncertainty. When applied to\nfeeders in Delhi, India, the approach highlights the cost-effectiveness of\nbattery storage to manage load growth while deferring network investments.\nAcross the low, medium and high battery storage capital cost projections for\n2030, we estimate that 18 to 29 GWh of battery storage capacity could be\ndeployed to defer 11,752 to 15,914 km of medium voltage distribution feeder\nlines that are loaded at 60\\% or more of their ampere capacity in 2030,\nresulting in 12 to 16\\% capital cost savings. Interestingly, the lowering\nstorage capital costs does not always increase NWA storage deployment, due to\nnetwork capacity constraints limiting opportunities for off-peak storage\ncharging.",

    "abstract": "Battery storage is essential to enhance the flexibility and reliability of\nelectric power systems by providing auxiliary services and load shifting.\nStorage owners typically gains incentives from quick responses to auxiliary\nservice prices, but frequent charging and discharging also reduce its lifetime.\nTherefore, this paper embeds the battery degradation cost into the operation\nsimulation to avoid overestimated profits caused by an aggressive bidding\nstrategy. Based on an operation simulation model, this paper conducts the\neconomic viability analysis of whole life cycle using the internal rate of\nreturn(IRR). A clustering method and a typical day method are developed to\nreduce the huge computational burdens in the life-cycle simulation of battery\nstorage. Our models and algorithms are validated by the case study of two\nmainstream technology routes currently: lithium nickel cobalt manganese oxide\n(NCM) batteries and lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries. Then a sensitivity\nanalysis is presented to identify the critical factors that boost battery\nstorage in the future. We evaluate the IRR results of different types of\nbattery storage to provide guidance for investment portfolio.",

A road heating is an electrical device\nwhich promotes snow melting by burying a heating cable as a thermal source\nunderground in such regions. When integrating the road heating into power\ndistribution systems, we need to optimize the flow of electric power by\nappropriately integrating distributed power sources and conventional power\ndistribution equipment. In this paper, we introduce a battery storage to the\npower distribution system including road heating, and extend the predictive\nswitching control of the systems due to the authors' previous study to the case\nwhere battery storage is installed. As a main result, we propose a predictive\nswitching control that utilizes photovoltaic (PV) power generation and surplus\npower stored in the battery storage effectively, and achieves the reduction of\ndistribution loss, attenuation of voltage fluctuation, and efficient snow\nmelting, simultaneously. We verify the effectiveness of the application of\nbattery storage through numerical simulation using actual time series data of\nweather conditions and active power of the PV power generation and load.",

    "title": "Weather-Driven Priority Charging for Battery Storage Systems in Hybrid Renewable Energy Grids",
    "abstract": "The integration of renewable energy into the power grid is often hindered by\nits fragmented infrastructure, leading to inefficient utilization due to the\nvariability of energy production and its reliance on weather conditions.\nBattery storage systems, while essential for stabilizing energy supply, face\nchallenges like sub-optimal energy distribution, accelerating battery\ndegradation, and reducing operational efficiency. This paper presents a novel\nsolution to these challenges by developing a large-scale, interconnected\nrenewable energy network that optimizes energy storage and distribution. The\nproposed system includes strategically placed battery storage facilities that\nstabilize energy production by compensating for fluctuations in renewable\noutput. A priority charging algorithm, informed by real-time weather\nforecasting and load monitoring, ensures that the most suitable battery systems\nare charged under varying conditions. Within each storage facility, a secondary\npriority charging algorithm minimizes battery degradation by ranking batteries\nbased on critical parameters such as state of health (SoH) and state of charge\n(SoC) and deciding which to charge. This comprehensive approach enhances the\nefficiency and longevity of battery storage systems, offering a more reliable\nand resilient renewable energy infrastructure.",

    "abstract": "Decentralized renewable energy systems can be low-carbon power sources, and\npromoters of local economies. It is often argued that decentralized generation\nalso helps reducing transmission costs, as generation is closer to the load,\nthus utilizing the transmission system less. The research presented here\naddresses the question whether or not, or under what circumstances this effect\nof avoided transmission can actually be seen for a community-operated cluster\nof photovoltaic (PV) power plants in two sample locations, one in Germany and\none in Japan. For the analysis, the newly developed instrument of MPI-MPE\ndiagrams is used, which plot the maximum power import (MPI) and maximum power\nexport (MPE) in relation to the reference case of no local generation. Results\nreveal that for moderately sized PV systems without battery storage, avoided\ntransmission can be seen in the Japanese model location, but not in Germany. It\nwas also found that an additional battery storage can lead to avoided\ntransmission in both locations, even for large sizes of installed PV capacity.",

We focus on policy approximations based on Model Predictive Control\n(MPC) and the use of the deterministic policy gradient method to optimize the\nMPC closed-loop performance in the presence of unmodelled stochasticity or\nmodel error. When the policy has a (nearly) bang-bang structure, we observe\nthat the policy gradient method can struggle to produce meaningful steps in the\npolicy parameters. To tackle this issue, we propose a homotopy strategy based\non the interior-point method, providing a relaxation of the policy during the\nlearning.

We adopt a dynamic programming\nframework to connect the daily bidding in frequency control markets with the\nlonger term peak shaving objective: reducing the maximum consumption peak over\nan entire billing period. The framework also allows to aggregate frequency\ncontrol capacity of multiple batteries installed at different sites, creating\nsynergies when the consumption profile peaks occur on different times.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a decision-making approach for the control of\ndistribution systems with distributed energy resources (DERs) equipped with\nphotovoltaic (PV) units and battery energy storage systems (BESS). The\nobjective is to minimize the total operational cost of the distribution system\nwhile satisfying the system operating constraints. The method is based on the\ndiscrete-time finite-horizon Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework. Different\naspects of the distribution system operation are considered, such as the\npossibilities of curtailment of PV generation, managing battery storage,\nreactive power injection, load shedding, and providing a flexibility service\nfor the transmission system. The model is tested for the IEEE 33-bus system\nwith two added DERs and the study cases involve various unexpected events. The\nexperimental results show that this method enables the attainment of relatively\nlow total cost values compared to the reference deterministic approach. The\nbenefits of applying this approach are particularly evident when there is a\nsignificant difference between the predicted and actual PV power generation.",

    "title": "Optimal sizing of solar photovoltaic and lithium battery storage to reduce grid electricity reliance in buildings",
    "abstract": "In alignment with the Paris Agreement, the city of Oxford in the UK aims to\nbecome carbon neutral by 2040. Renewable energy help achieve this target by\nreducing the reliance on carbon-intensive grid electricity. This research seeks\nto optimally size solar photovoltaic and lithium battery storage systems,\nreducing Oxford's grid electricity reliance in buildings. The analysis starts\nwith modeling the electricity demand. The model uses Elexon electricity\nsettlement profiles, and assembles them into the demand profile according to\nthe quantity and types of buildings in Oxford. Then, solar generation is\nmodeled using Pfenninger and Staffell's method. Solar photovoltaic and lithium\nstorage systems are sized using a hybridized analytical and iterative method.\nFirst, the method calculates the solar system size search range, then iterates\nthrough the range. At each solar size, the method calculates and iterates\nthrough the storage system size search range. Within each iteration, the\nrenewable system is simulated using demand and generation data with a\nsimplified system set-up and the conventional operation strategy. The method\noutputs combinations of solar system capacity, storage system capacity, and\ngrid electricity import. Each combination's levelized cost of electricity is\ncalculated, and the lowest cost combination is the optimal sizing. Solar and\nstorage system costs are projected from 2019 to 2100, and the optimal sizing is\ncalculated for each year. The result shows that solar photovoltaic is\neconomically competitive, but lithium storage cost is still too high. As solar\nand storage prices continue to drop, they will take up greater portions of the\nenergy system. However, there will always be a need for the grid, as it\nprovides flexibility and can meet demands that are too costly for solar and\nstorage",

Under this framework, using real data we show the\nelectricity bill of users can be reduced by up to 15\\%. Furthermore, we\ndemonstrate that the saving from joint optimization is often larger than the\nsum of the optimal savings when the battery is used for the two individual\napplications.

While\nSoC-dependent bids capture storage's degradation and opportunity costs, such\nbids result in a non-convex optimization in the market clearing process.

    "abstract": "This article presents and describes a 229 bus test system that includes wind,\nhydro and fossil fuel power plants. It represents the Northeast subsystem of\nthe Brazilian Interconnected Power System (BIPS). The test system supplies a\nload of 4.17 GW, being 13% powered by wind farms, which is the current wind\npower penetration level of the BIPS. The data comprehends different load levels\nbased on the typical load behavior and typical capacity factors of wind, hydro\nand fossil fuel plants, as well as the capacity of transmission and\nsub-transmission lines, transformers, and the adopted structure for the test\nsystem. The data is compiled considering models and operating scenarios of the\nBIPS, and allow performing studies of static voltage stability, sensitivity of\nvoltage stability margin considering the wind farms, and multi-objective\noptimization considering market constraints. The results of the simulations\nwith the test system indicate the consistency of their data structure and its\napplicability to different studies of electric power systems.",

Daily\nCO2 emissions are estimated from a diverse range of activity data, including:\nhourly to daily electrical power generation data of 29 countries, monthly\nproduction data and production indices of industry processes of 62\ncountries/regions, daily mobility data and mobility indices of road\ntransportation of 416 cities worldwide. Individual flight location data and\nmonthly data were utilised for aviation and maritime transportation sectors\nestimates. In addition, monthly fuel consumption data that corrected for daily\nair temperature of 206 countries were used for estimating the emissions from\ncommercial and residential buildings. This Carbon Monitor dataset manifests the\ndynamic nature of CO2 emissions through daily, weekly and seasonal variations\nas influenced by workdays and holidays, as well as the unfolding impacts of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. The Carbon Monitor near-real-time CO2 emission dataset shows\na 7.8% decline of CO2 emission globally from Jan 1st to Apr 30th in 2020 when\ncompared with the same period in 2019, and detects a re-growth of CO2 emissions\nby late April which are mainly attributed to the recovery of economy activities\nin China and partial easing of lockdowns in other countries. Further, this\ndaily updated CO2 emission dataset could offer a range of opportunities for\nrelated scientific research and policy making.",

    "abstract": "Goals to reduce carbon emissions and changing electricity prices due to\nincreasing penetrations of wind power generation affect the planning and\noperation of district heating production systems. Through extensive\nmultivariate sensitivity analysis, this study estimates the robustness of\nfuture cost-optimal heat production systems under changing electricity prices,\nfuel cost and investment cost. Optimal production capacities are installed\nchoosing from a range of well-established production and storage technologies\nincluding boilers, combined heat and power (CHP) units, power-to-heat\ntechnologies and heat storages. The optimal heat production system is\ncharacterized in three different electricity pricing scenarios: Historical,\nwind power dominated and demand dominated. Coal CHP, large heat pumps and heat\nstorages dominate the optimal system if fossil fuels are allowed. Heat pumps\nand storages take over if fossil fuels are excluded. The capacity allocation\nbetween CHP and heat pumps is highly dependent on cost assumptions in the\nfossil fuel scenario, but the optimal capacities become much more robust if\nfossil fuels are not included. System cost becomes less robust in a fossil free\nscenario. If the electricity pricing is dominated by wind power generation or\nby the electricity demand, heat pumps become more favorable compared to\ncogeneration units. The need for heat storage more than doubles, if fossil\nfuels are not included, as the heating system becomes more closely coupled to\nthe electricity system.",

    "title": "Effects of Low Pressure Condition on Partial Discharges in WBG Power Electronics Modules",
    "abstract": "The aviation industry aims to reduce CO2 emission by reducing energy\nconsumption and benefitting from more electrical systems than those based on\nfossil fuels. The more electric aircraft (MEA) can take advantage of the drives\nbased on wide bandgap (WBG) based power modules that are lighter and can bear\nhigher voltages and currents. However, the fast-rise and repetitive voltage\npulses generated by WBG-based systems can endanger the insulating property of\ndielectric materials due to the partial discharges. PDs cause the local\nbreakdown of insulation materials in regions with high electric field\nmagnitude. In the case of power electronic modules, silicone gel, which is a\npredominant type of encapsulation material, is susceptible to these PDs. In\nthis study, it is aimed to investigate the impact of rise time on various PD\ncharacteristics including PD true charge magnitude, inception and extinction\nfields, duration, and so forth. Besides, those systems that are anticipated to\noperate under harsh environmental conditions such as naval or aviation\nindustries, may expect additional threat. Therefore, this paper puts forth the\ncombination of low pressure conditions and fast rise, high frequency square\nwave pulses. The results demonstrate that more intense and more intense ones\nare going to be imposed at lower pressures. COMSOL Multiphysics interfaced with\nMATLAB is used to simulate the PD detection process based on the experimental\ndata found in the literature.",

    "abstract": "To achieve the ambitious aims of the Paris climate agreement, the majority of\nfossil-fuel reserves needs to remain underground. As current national\ngovernment commitments to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions are insufficient by\nfar, actors such as institutional and private investors and the social movement\non divestment from fossil fuels could play an important role in putting\npressure on national governments on the road to decarbonization. Using a\nstochastic agent-based model of co-evolving financial market and investors'\nbeliefs about future climate policy on an adaptive social network, here we find\nthat the dynamics of divestment from fossil fuels shows potential for social\ntipping away from a fossil-fuel based economy. Our results further suggest that\nsocially responsible investors have leverage: a small share of 10--20\\,\\% of\nsuch moral investors is sufficient to initiate the burst of the carbon bubble,\nconsistent with the Pareto Principle. These findings demonstrate that\ndivestment has potential for contributing to decarbonization alongside other\nsocial movements and policy instruments, particularly given the credible\nimminence of strong international climate policy. Our analysis also indicates\nthe possible existence of a carbon bubble with potentially destabilizing\neffects to the economy.",

    "title": "Electric Vehicle E-hailing Fleet Dispatching and Charge Scheduling",
    "abstract": "With recent developments in vehicle and battery technologies, electric\nvehicles (EVs) are rapidly getting established as a sustainable alternative to\ntraditional fossil-fuel vehicles. This has made the large-scale electrification\nof ride-sourcing operations a practical viability, providing an opportunity for\na leap toward urban sustainability goals. Despite having a similar driving\nrange to fossil-fuel vehicles, EVs are disadvantaged by their long charging\ntimes which compromises the total fleet service time. To efficiently manage an\nEV fleet, the operator needs to address the charge scheduling problem as part\nof the dispatch strategy. This paper introduces a probabilistic matching method\nwhich evaluates the optimal trip and charging decisions for a fully electrified\ne-hailing fleet, with the goal of maximising the operator's expected market\nprofit. In the midst of the technological transition towards autonomous\nvehicles, it is also critical to include stochastic driver behaviours in\ntransport models as presented in this paper. Since drivers may either comply\nwith trip dispatching or choose to reject a charging trip order considering the\nadditional fees, contrary to the commonly assumed fleet autonomy, the proposed\nmethod designs an incentivisation scheme (charging discounts) to encourage\ndriver compliance so that the planned charging trips and the associated profit\ncan be realised.",

    "title": "Role of hydrogen in decarbonizing China's electricity and hard-to-abate sectors",
    "abstract": "Green hydrogen has the potential to address two pressing problems in a\nzero-carbon energy system: balancing seasonal variability of solar and wind in\nthe electricity sector, and replacing fossil fuels in hard-to-abate sectors.\nHowever, the previous research only separately modeled the electricity and\nhard-to-abate sectors, which is unable to capture how the interaction between\nthe two sectors influences the energy system cost. In this study, focusing on\nChina, we deploy an electricity system planning model to examine the cost\nimplications of green hydrogen to fully decarbonize the electricity system and\nhard-to-abate sectors. Our results reveal that green hydrogen enables a 17%\nreduction in the levelized cost of a zero-carbon electricity system relative to\nthat without hydrogen. However, cost savings hinge on the availability of\nunderground hydrogen storage capacities and electric transmission expansion.\nMore importantly, coupling hydrogen infrastructure in the electricity and\nhard-to-abate sectors not only reduces energy costs compared to a decoupled\nenergy system but also makes green hydrogen cost-competitive compared to fossil\nfuel-based gray and blue hydrogen in China.",

    "abstract": "This paper uses established and recently introduced methods from the applied\nmathematics and statistics literature to study trends in the propagation and\ncapacity of low-carbon hydrogen projects over the past two decades. First, we\njudiciously apply a regression model to estimate the association between\nvarious predictors and the capacity of global hydrogen projects. Next, we turn\nto the geographic propagation of low-carbon hydrogen projects, where we apply a\nrecently introduced method to explore the geographic variance of hydrogen\nprojects over time. Then, we demonstrate that most geographic regions display\nlinear growth in cumulative plants and apply distance correlation to determine\nthe nonlinear dependence between the two most prolific regions - North America\nand Europe. Finally, we study the time-varying regional consistency between the\ncontribution of green vs fossil fuel plants to the total number and capacity of\nhydrogen plants.",

    "title": "Enabling Clean Energy Resilience with Machine Learning-Empowered Underground Hydrogen Storage",
    "abstract": "To address the urgent challenge of climate change, there is a critical need\nto transition away from fossil fuels towards sustainable energy systems, with\nrenewable energy sources playing a pivotal role. However, the inherent\nvariability of renewable energy, without effective storage solutions, often\nleads to imbalances between energy supply and demand. Underground Hydrogen\nStorage (UHS) emerges as a promising long-term storage solution to bridge this\ngap, yet its widespread implementation is impeded by the high computational\ncosts associated with high fidelity UHS simulations. This paper introduces UHS\nfrom a data-driven perspective and outlines a roadmap for integrating machine\nlearning into UHS, thereby facilitating the large-scale deployment of UHS.",

    "title": "Dynamic Linepack Depletion Models for Natural Gas Pipeline Networks",
    "abstract": "Given the critical role played by natural gas in providing electricity, heat,\nand other essential services, better models are needed to understand the\ndynamics of natural gas networks during extreme events. This paper aims at\nestablishing appropriate and fast simulation models to capture the slow\ndynamics of linepack depletion for ideal isothermal natural gas pipeline\nnetworks. Instead of solving partial differential equations (PDE) on a large\nscale, three alternative implicit ordinary differential equation (ODE)\nsimulation techniques are derived and discussed. The first one is commonly used\nin the literature with a slack node assumption. We show that the system of\nequations associated with this model is degenerate when flux injections are\ncontrolled (i.e. specified) at all nodes. To recover regularity under such a\ncondition, two novel implicit ODE models are proposed, both with different\ntechniques for specifying boundary conditions. They are easy to derive and\nefficient to simulate with standard ODE solvers. More importantly, they present\nuseful frameworks for analyzing how networks respond to system-wide mass flux\nimbalances. These techniques offer different alternatives for simulating system\ndynamics based on how sources and loads are chosen to be modeled, and they are\nall proven to be regular (non-degenerate) in tree-structured networks. These\nproposed techniques are all tested on the 20-node Belgium network. The\nsimulation results show that the conventional model with the slack node\nassumption cannot effectively capture linepack depletion under long term\nsystem-wide mass flux imbalance, while the proposed models can characterize the\nnetwork behavior until the linepack is completely depleted.",

    "abstract": "We demonstrate from molecular dynamics simulations that windowed carbon\nnanotubes can efficiently separate CO2 from the CO2/CH4 mixture, resembling\npolymeric hollow fibers for gas separation. Three CO2/CH4 mixtures with 30%,\n50% and 80% CO2 are investigated as a function of applied pressure from 80 to\n180 bar. In all simulated conditions, only CO2 permeation is observed; CH4 is\ncompletely rejected by the nitrogen-functionalized windows or pores on the\nnanotube wall in the accessible timescale, while maintaining a fast diffusion\nrate along the tube. The estimated time-dependent CO2 permeance ranges from 107\nto 105 GPU (gas permeation unit), compared with ~100 GPU for typical polymeric\nmembranes. CO2/CH4 selectivity is estimated to be ~108 from the difference in\nfree-energy barriers of permeation. This work suggests that a windowed carbon\nnanotube can be used as a highly efficient medium, configurable in\nhollow-fiber-like modules, for removing CO2 from natural gas.",

    "abstract": "Natural gas transmission pipelines are complex systems whose flow\ncharacteristics are governed by challenging non-linear physical behavior. These\npipelines extend over hundreds and even thousands of miles. Gas is typically\ninjected into the system at a constant rate, and a series of compressors are\ndistributed along the pipeline to boost the gas pressure to maintain system\npressure and throughput. These compressors consume a portion of the gas, and\none goal of the operator is to control the compressor operation to minimize\nthis consumption while satisfying pressure constraints at the gas load points.\nThe optimization of these operations is computationally challenging. Many\npipelines simply rely on the intuition and prior experience of operators to\nmake these decisions. Here, we present a new geometric programming approach for\noptimizing compressor operation in natural gas pipelines. Using models of real\nnatural gas pipelines, we show that the geometric programming algorithm\nconsistently outperforms approaches that mimic existing state of practice.",

    "title": "Natural Gas Short-Term Operation Problem with Dynamics: A Rank Minimization Approach",
    "abstract": "Natural gas-fired generation units can hedge against the volatility in the\nuncertain renewable generation, which may occur during very short periods. It\nis crucial to utilize models capable of correctly capturing the natural gas\nnetwork dynamics induced by the volatile demand of gas-fired units. The\nWeymouth equation is commonly implemented in literature to avoid dealing with\nthe mathematical complications of solving the original governing differential\nequations of the natural gas dynamics. However, it is shown in this paper that\nthis approach is not reliable in the short-term operation problem. Here, the\nmerit of the non-convex transient model is compared with the simplified\nWeymouth equation, and the drawbacks of employing the Weymouth equation are\nillustrated. The results demonstrate how changes in the natural gas demand are\nmet by adjustment in the pressure within pipelines rather than the output of\nnatural gas suppliers. This work presents a convex relaxation scheme for the\noriginal non-linear and non-convex natural gas flow equations with dynamics,\nutilizing a rank minimization approach to ensure the tightness. The proposed\nmethod renders a computationally efficient framework that can accurately solve\nthe non-convex non-linear gas operation problem and accurately capture its\ndynamics. Also, the results suggest that the proposed model improves the\nsolution optimality and solution time compared to the original non-linear\nnon-convex model.

This paper investigates the\nimpacts of FRPs on the operation of interdependent electricity and natural gas\nnetworks. To accurately model and reflect the effects of variations in the\nnatural gas fuel demand on the natural gas network, a dynamic Optimal Gas Flow\n(OGF) formulation is utilized. The non-convex dynamic model of the natural gas\nsystem is represented in a convex form via a tight relaxation scheme. An\nimproved distributed optimization method is proposed to solve the coordinated\noperation problem in a privacy-preserving manner, where the two infrastructures\nonly share limited information. We introduce the Inexact Varying Alternating\nDirection Method of Multipliers (IV-ADMM) and show that compared with the\nclassic ADMM, it converges considerably faster and in fewer iterations. Through\na comparison of day-ahead and real-time operation planning results, it is\nconcluded that without accounting for natural gas network dynamics, the FRP\nmodel is not a trustworthy tool in day-ahead planning against uncertainties.",

    "abstract": "In an integrated electricity-gas system (IEGS), the tight coupling of power\nand natural gas systems is embodied by frequent changes in gas withdrawal from\ngas-fired units to provide regulation services for the power system to handle\nuncertainty, which may in turn endanger the secure operation of the natural gas\nsystem and ultimately affect the safety of the whole IEGS. Hence, it is\nnecessary to accurately and efficiently evaluate the dynamic security region\n(DSR) of the natural gas system in the IEGS by considering the real-time\ndynamic characteristics of natural gas systems, which are not satisfactorily\nhandled in state-of-the-art works. To bridge this gap, this paper first\nconceptionally verifies the necessity of the DSR and establishes its\nmathematical model. Then, a dimensionality reduction method is proposed for the\nefficient solution and visualization of the high-dimensional DSR evaluation\nmodel. A fast evaluation (FE) algorithm is developed to address the\ndifficulties of the nonconvex dynamic constraints in the reduced DSR model.\nFinally, the necessity and notable advantages of the proposed DSR model and FE\nare verified based on small and relatively large test systems in comparison\nwith common security region models and algorithms. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first paper that comprehensively presents models and\nefficient algorithms regarding the DSR of natural gas systems in an IEGS.",

    "abstract": "The decarbonization of the power sector plays a pivotal role in economy-wide\ndecarbonization to set the world on track to limit warming to 1.5{\\deg}C by\n2050. Carbon emission markets can play a significant role in this transition by\nputting a price on carbon and giving electricity producers an incentive to\nreduce their emissions. In this paper, we study the operational equilibrium of\nan integrated regional/jurisdictional energy system that comprises an\nelectricity market, a natural gas market, and a carbon emission market. We\nfirst propose the novel role of a regional carbon market operator (CMO).\nDifferent than the conventional cap-and-trade carbon trading mechanism, the\nproposed CMO manages carbon allowance trading in a centralized jurisdictional\ncarbon emission market. We then develop the formulation to identify the\noperational equilibrium of the electricity, natural gas, and carbon emission\nmarkets based on their interactions. The proposed equilibrium can be obtained\nby solving the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of all three operational\nmodels simultaneously.

This work aims\nto develop an optimization program for a dynamic, hetero-functional graph\ntheory-based model of an engineering system. The manuscript first introduces a\ngeneral approach to define a dynamic system model by integrating the device\nmodels in the hetero-functional graph theory structural model. To this end, the\nwork leverages Petri net dynamics and the hetero-functional incidence tensor.\nThe respective Petri net-based models are translated into the quadratic program\ncanonical form to finalize the optimization program. The optimization program\nis demonstrated through the application of the program to a hydrogen-natural\ngas infrastructure test case. Four distinct scenarios are optimized to\ndemonstrate potential synergies or cascading network effects of policy across\ninfrastructures.\n  This work develops the first hetero-functional graph theory-based\noptimization program and demonstrates that the program can be used to optimize\nflows across a multi-operand network, transform the operands in the network,\nstore operands over time, analyze the behavior for a quadratic cost function,\nand implement it for a generic, continuous, large flexible engineering systems\nof arbitrary topology.",

    "title": "An Investigation of Natural Gas as a Substitute for Diesel in Heavy Duty Trucks and Associated Considerations",
    "abstract": "In this paper, applicability of natural gas fuel for transportation as\ncompared to diesel is investigated. This study investigates a promising\ntechnology for the heavy duty truck sector of transportation as a target for\nconversion from diesel to natural gas. The supply of natural gas is limited so\nwe also verify the available domestic supply quantities both before and after a\nfleet conversion. This paper concludes with an economic discussion regarding\nJavon's paradox and the fungibility of natural gas as compared to that of oil.\nIn order to determine if natural gas can replace diesel for the country's heavy\nduty truck transportation needs, the energy equivalent and efficiency of\nnatural gas alternatives should be compared to diesel. There are two\nalternatives for using natural gas as a replacement for diesel; compressed\nnatural gas and liquefied natural gas.",

    "abstract": "As a part of the integrated energy system (IES), gas pipeline networks can\nprovide additional flexibility to power systems through coordinated optimal\ndispatch. An accurate pipeline network model is critical for the optimal\noperation and control of IESs. However, inaccuracies or unavailability of\naccurate pipeline parameters often introduce errors in the mathematical models\nof such networks. This paper proposes a physics-informed recurrent network\n(PIRN) model to identify the state-space model of gas pipelines. The approach\ncombines data-driven learning from measurement data with the fluid dynamics\ndescribed by partial differential equations. By embedding the physical\nstate-space model within the recurrent network, parameter identification is\ntransformed into a training process for a PIRN. Similar to standard recurrent\nneural networks, this model can be implemented using the PyTorch framework and\ntrained via backpropagation. Case studies demonstrate that our method\naccurately estimates gas pipeline models from sparse terminal node\nmeasurements, providing robust performance and significantly higher parameter\nefficiency. Furthermore, the identified models can be seamlessly integrated\ninto optimization frameworks.",

The\ndeposited sulfur behaves as a superstrate layer above a sensing microstrip\npatch antenna that is optimally placed on the inner wall of the gas pipeline.\nIncreasing the superstrate thickness by the sulfur deposition alters the\nantenna resonance behavior, which can be monitored externally. The effect of\nuneven or bumpy sulfur deposition is studied. Sensing antennas positioned\noutside a plexiglass pipeline are also investigated to observe the change in\nthe antenna impedance matching with accumulating sulfur superstrate. Lab-based\nmeasured results agreed well with the simulated responses using commercial\nelectromagnetic software.

    "abstract": "To obtain the accurate transient states of the big scale natural gas pipeline\nnetworks under the bad data and non-zero mean noises conditions, a robust\nKalman filter-based dynamic state estimation method is proposed using the\nlinearized gas pipeline transient flow equations in this paper. Firstly, the\ndynamic state estimation model is built. Since the gas pipeline transient flow\nequations are less than the states, the boundary conditions are used as\nsupplementary constraints to predict the transient states. To increase the\nmeasurement redundancy, the zero mass flow rate constraints at the sink nodes\nare taken as virtual measurements. Secondly, to ensure the stability under bad\ndata condition, the robust Kalman filter algorithm is proposed by introducing a\ntime-varying scalar matrix to regulate the measurement error variances\ncorrectly according to the innovation vector at every time step. At last, the\nproposed method is applied to a 30-node gas pipeline networks in several kinds\nof measurement conditions. The simulation shows that the proposed robust\ndynamic state estimation can decrease the effects of bad data and achieve\nbetter estimating results.",

    "abstract": "In the existing literatures for the risk evaluation of electricity-gas\nintegrated energy system (EGIES), the impacts of gas leakage in pipelines are\nignored. This paper presents a method to incorporate the failure modes of gas\npipeline leakage in EGIES risk evaluation. A Markov state transition model of\ngas pipeline with multi-state and multi-mode transition process, and a bi-level\nMonte Carlo sampling method for this model are developed. A stochastic topology\nchange based network model of EGIES considering the pipeline leakage failure\nmodes is presented. The risk indices for EGIES based on the load shedding,\nincluding those specifically for gas leakage risks, are also proposed. An EGIES\nwith a modified RBTS and a 7-node gas system was used to demonstrate an\napplication of the proposed method and models. The results indicate that\npipeline leakage failures have significant impacts on the risk of EGIES.\nIgnoring pipeline leakage failures in the risk evaluation of EGIES will result\nin an overly underestimation of system risk and most likely a misleading\nconclusion in system planning.",

    "abstract": "In many parts of the world, electric power systems have seen a significant\nshift towards generation from renewable energy and natural gas. Because of\ntheir ability to flexibly adjust power generation in real time, gas-fired power\nplants are frequently seen as the perfect partner for variable renewable\ngeneration. However, this reliance on gas generation increases interdependence\nand propagates uncertainty between power grids and gas pipelines, and brings\ncoordination and uncertainty management challenges. To address these issues, we\npropose an uncertainty management framework for uncertain, but bounded gas\nconsumption by gas-fired power plants. The admissible ranges are computed based\non a joint optimization problem for the combined gas and electricity networks,\nwhich involves chance-constrained scheduling for the electric grid and a novel\nrobust optimization formulation for the natural gas network. This formulation\nensures feasibility of the integrated system with a high probability, while\nproviding a tractable numerical formulation. A key advance with respect to\nexisting methods is that our method is based on a physically accurate,\nvalidated model for transient gas pipeline flows. Our case study benchmarks our\nproposed formulation against methods that ignore how reserve activation impacts\nthe fuel use of gas power plants, and only consider predetermined gas\nconsumption. The results demonstrate the importance of considering uncertainty\nto avoid operating constraint violations and curtailment of gas to the\ngenerators.",

    "abstract": "The coal industry contributes significantly to the social economy, but the\nemission of greenhouse gases puts huge pressure on the environment in the\nprocess of mining, transportation, and power generation. In the integrated\nenergy system (IES), the current research about the power-to-gas (P2G)\ntechnology mainly focuses on the injection of hydrogen generated from renewable\nenergy electrolyzed water into natural gas pipelines, which may cause hydrogen\nembrittlement of the pipeline and cannot be repaired. In this paper, sufficient\nhydrogen energy can be produced through P2G technology and coal-to-hydrogen\n(C2H) of coal gasification, considering the scenario of coal district is rich\nin coal and renewable energy. In order to transport the mined coal to the\ndestination, hydrogen heavy trucks have a broad space for development, which\ncan absorb hydrogen energy in time and avoid potentially dangerous hydrogen\ninjection into pipelines and relatively expensive hydrogen storage. An\noptimized scheduling model of electric-gas IES is proposed based on\nsecond-order cone programming (SOCP). In the model proposed above, the closed\nindustrial loop (including coal mining, hydrogen production, truck\ntransportation of coal, and integrated energy systems) has been innovatively\nstudied, to consume renewable energy and coordinate multi-energy. Finally, an\nelectric-gas IES study case constructed by IEEE 30-node power system and\nBelgium 24-node natural gas network was used to analyze and verify the economy,\nlow carbon, and effectiveness of the proposed mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Gas-fired units (GFUs) with rapid regulation capabilities are considered an\neffective tool to mitigate fluctuations in the generation of renewable energy\nsources and have coupled electricity power systems (EPSs) and natural gas\nsystems (NGSs) more tightly. However, this tight coupling leads to uncertainty\npropagation, a challenge for the real-time dispatch of such integrated electric\nand gas systems (IEGSs). Moreover, pipeline leakage failures in the NGS may\nthreaten the electricity supply reliability of the EPS through GFUs. To address\nthese problems, this paper first establishes an operational model considering\ngas pipeline dynamic characteristics under uncertain leakage failures for the\nNGS and then presents a stochastic IEGS real-time economic dispatch (RTED)\nmodel considering both uncertainty propagation and pipeline leakage\nuncertainty. To quickly solve this complicated large-scale stochastic\noptimization problem, a novel notion of the coupling boundary dynamic\nadjustment region considering pipeline leakage failure (LCBDAR) is proposed to\ncharacterize the dynamic characteristics of the NGS boundary connecting GFUs.\nBased on the LCBDAR, a noniterative decentralized solution is proposed to\ndecompose the original stochastic RTED model into two subproblems that are\nsolved separately by the EPS and NGS operators, thus preserving their data\nprivacy. In particular, only one-time data interaction from the NGS to the EPS\nis required. Case studies on several IEGSs at different scales demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed method.",

To predict the states of the system, the Holt's exponential\nsmoothing techniques and nonlinear dynamic equations of gas pipelines are\napplied to establish the power and gas system equations, respectively. The\nsquare-root cubature Kalman filter algorithm is utilized to address the\nnumerical challenges posed by the strongly nonlinear system equations. The\nboundary conditions in the gas system include the flow balances at sink nodes,\nand the mass flow rates of loads have to be predicted at each computation step.\nFor the prediction of load mass flows, the long short-term memory network is\nemployed, known for its effectiveness in time series prediction. Consequently,\na combined method based on the square-root cubature Kalman filter and the long\nshort-term memory network is proposed for tracking integrated gas and power\nsystems. To evaluate the tracking performances of the proposed method, the\nIEEE-39 bus power system and GasLib-40 node gas system are used to form the\ntesting system. Simulation results demonstrate high precision in tracking the\ndynamic states of power and gas systems.

    "abstract": "The current transition in the European energy sector towards climate\nneutrality requires detailed and reliable energy system modeling. The quality\nand relevance of the energy system modeling highly depend on the availability\nand quality of model input datasets. However, detailed and reliable datasets,\nespecially for energy infrastructure, are still missing. In this contribution,\nwe present our approach to developing an open-source and open-data model of the\ngas transport network in Europe. Various freely available data sources were\nused to collect gas transport datasets and their attributes. The resulting\ndatasets of the various data sources were processed, and unique elements were\nmerged together. Statistical and heuristic methods were used to generate\nmissing network element attributes.\n  As a result, we successfully created a gas transport network model only using\nopen-source data. The SciGRID_gas model contains 237.000 km of pipeline data\nwhich is a very good approximation to know length values. In addition, datasets\nof compressor stations, LNG terminals, storage, production sides, gas power\nplants, border points, and demand time series are provided. Finally, we have\ndiscussed data gaps and how they can potentially be closed.",

    "title": "Questioning the 239Pu(n,2n)238Pu cross section shape above emission threshold",
    "abstract": "In the light of the JEF(F) European project longstanding story according to\nthe determination of the most exact shape of the 239Pu(n, 2n)238Pu reaction\ncross section and a recent measurement by Meot et al., this paper aims to shed\nanother light on this topic by bringing new theoretical feedback. To achieve\nthis goal, the AVXSF-LNG computer program has been upgraded to model\nsecond-chance reactions using its decay-probability module and, then chained to\nthe TALYS-ECIS06 nuclear reaction system of codes. Present diligent calculation\nof the (n,2n) cross section over the energy range from the threshold to the\nonset of third-chance fission at about 12 MeV, suggests that current\nevaluations under-estimate the 239Pu(n,2n) cross section below 10 MeV;\nunder-estimation of the order of 7% relatively to the JEFF-3.1 evaluation. On\nthis ground, we propose an upward correction to the normalization of the\nmeasurement by Meot et al. Correction factor of about 1.24 with a maximum\nuncertainty on present fitted model estimated to 11.6%. Latter value is\nextracted from a sensitivity analysis of the calculation route to the level\ndensity model that is selected for the non-equilibrated residual nucleus and to\nalternative choices we can make in terms of neutron fission cross section\nmeasurement references for the 238Pu and 239Pu target nuclei.",

    "title": "Domain Consistent Industrial Decarbonisation of Global Coal Power Plants",
    "abstract": "Machine learning and optimisation techniques (MLOPT) hold significant\npotential to accelerate the decarbonisation of industrial systems by enabling\ndata-driven operational improvements. However, the practical application of\nMLOPT in industrial settings is often hindered by a lack of domain compliance\nand system-specific consistency, resulting in suboptimal solutions with limited\nreal-world applicability. To address this challenge, we propose a novel\nhuman-in-the-loop (HITL) constraint-based optimisation framework that\nintegrates domain expertise with data-driven methods, ensuring solutions are\nboth technically sound and operationally feasible. We demonstrate the efficacy\nof this framework through a case study focused on enhancing the thermal\nefficiency and reducing the turbine heat rate of a 660 MW supercritical\ncoal-fired power plant. By embedding domain knowledge as constraints within the\noptimisation process, our approach yields solutions that align with the plant's\noperational patterns and are seamlessly integrated into its control systems.\nEmpirical validation confirms a mean improvement in thermal efficiency of\n0.64\\% and a mean reduction in turbine heat rate of 93 kJ/kWh. Scaling our\nanalysis to 59 global coal power plants with comparable capacity and fuel type,\nwe estimate a cumulative lifetime reduction of 156.4 million tons of carbon\nemissions. These results underscore the transformative potential of our\nHITL-MLOPT framework in delivering domain-compliant, implementable solutions\nfor industrial decarbonisation, offering a scalable pathway to mitigate the\nenvironmental impact of coal-based power generation worldwide.",

Repurposing coal power plants\ncould recoup profits and reduce carbon emissions using the existing\ninfrastructure and grid connections.

The proposed capacity expansion model considers\nthe co-locations of DCs, local renewablewith the system-generation, andlevel\ncoal retir energy storage ement and retrofitting. We optimize the DC system\nconfigurations under the hourly-matching carbon policy and flexible operations.\nResults show that under hourly-matching carbon constraints, the retrofitted TES\ncould complement the operations of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) to reduce\nsystem costs. This could render DCs with optimal co-located renewable\ngenerations and energy storage more cost-effective than unconstrained DCs.",

    "abstract": "Wind energy has been integrated into the power system with the hope that it\nimproves the energy efficiency and decreases greenhouse gas emission. However,\nseveral studies over the world imply that the result was in the opposite way\nthat was hoped mainly because of the negative correlation between wind\navailability and load. Under the situation, coal power plants are forced to\ncycle while they are not designed to do so. To prevent this unwanted result\nfrom occurring, a unit commitment decision should include the use of fuel and\nthe emission rate during the ramp up/down process. This paper proposes a new\nunit commitment decision process to accommodate the economic and the\nenvironmental costs associated with the ramping process. The costs are, in\ngeneral, not convex because there is positive cost if a generator output\nchanges significantly regardless of directions. As a result, the problem might\nbe nonconvex. A piece-wise linear cost curve is introduced to model the impact\nof ramping processes. With the curve, a convex linear programming is\nformulated, and the impact of a governmental policy is discussed.",

    "abstract": "India set two Nationally Determined Contribution targets to achieve the net\nzero carbon emission goal by 2070, which requires deep decarbonization of\nIndia's power generation sector. Yet, coal power generation contributes to more\nthan 60\\% of its total power generation, and policies still permit further coal\nfleet expansion and lifetime extensions. In this paper, we investigate the role\nof retrofitting India's coal plants for carbon capture and storage and biomass\nco-firing in developing the net-zero power system. We model the power\ngeneration and transmission network expansions across 30 Indian states in four\nrepresentative grid evolution scenarios under progressively tighter carbon\nemission caps, taking into account sub-national coal price variation and\nthermal efficiency of individual coal plants. We find that coal plant\nretrofitting could happen by 2035 when an annual carbon cap for the power\ngeneration sector is less than 1,000 million tons CO$_2$. This reduces the\nunabated coal plant capacity, electricity generation, and carbon abatement\ncosts. Exploiting renewable energy potentials solely, such as wind resources,\ncould reduce carbon abatement costs significantly but will result in low coal\nplant utilization and uneven renewable generation deployment between Southern\nand Central regions concerning energy justice.",

In\nthis paper, we analyze the statistical significance of CO2 emissions reductions\nin the U.S. power sector from March through December 2020. We use Gaussian\nprocess (GP) regression to assess whether CO2 emissions reductions would have\noccurred with reasonable probability in the absence of COVID-19 considering\nuncertainty due to factors unrelated to the pandemic and adjusting for weather,\nseasonality, and recent emissions trends. We find that monthly CO2 emissions\nreductions are only statistically significant in April and May 2020 considering\nhypothesis tests at 5% significance levels. Separately, we consider the\npotential impact of COVID-19 on coal-fired power plant retirements through\n2022. We find that only a small percentage of U.S. coal power plants are at\nrisk of retirement due to a possible COVID-19-related sustained reduction in\nelectricity demand and prices.

    "abstract": "In the first section, this report analyses Nuclear Power Plants (NPPs) in the\ncontext of megaprojects, explaining why they are often delivered over budget\nand late. In the second section, the report discusses how Small Modular\nReactors (SMRs) might address these issues. Megaprojects are extremely risky\nand often implemented after a sub-optimal phase of project planning leading to\nunderestimations of the costs and overestimation of short-term benefits. When\nconsidering adherence to schedule and budget, often megaprojects might be\nconsidered a failure, and optimism bias, strategic mis-rapresentation,\ncomplexity, poor planning, poor risk allocation, poor scope management are all\nreasons to explain their over budget and delay. For megaprojects, especially in\nthe nuclear field, a key strategy to achieve good performances appears to be\nthe standardization. This standardization needs to be twofold: (i) technical\nstandardisation, i.e. the construction of very similar design over and over,\nand (ii) the project delivery chain standardisation, i.e. the same stakeholders\ninvolved in the delivery of a project that is replicable multiple times. Under\nthis perspective, given their size and standardisation potential, SMRs, might\nbe a suitable class of NPP for several countries. Yet, if the economy of scale\nis the only driver considered, SMRs are hardly competitive with large NPPs (or\neven with gas or coal power plants). However, a fleet of standard SMRs might\nbalance the lack of economy of scale with the economy of multiples, and the\ndelivery of several standardised SMR projects might be the key to achieve good\nproject management performances in the nuclear sector. However, the deployment\nof SMRs faces a number of challenges from several perspectives, such as the\nlicencing, supply chain and financing ones. These challenges might be enormous,\nbut so are the potential rewards too.",

    "title": "Human Reliability Analysis for Oil and Gas Operations: Analysis of Existing Methods",
    "abstract": "In the petroleum industry, Quantitative Risk Analysis (QRA) has been one of\nthe main tools for risk management. To date, QRA has mostly focused on\ntechnical barriers, despite many accidents having human failure as a primary\ncause or a contributing factor. Human Reliability Analysis (HRA) allows for the\nassessment of the human contribution to risk to be assessed both qualitatively\nand quantitatively. Most credible and highly advanced HRA methods have largely\nbeen developed and applied in support of nuclear power plants control room\noperations and in context of probabilistic risk analysis. Moreover, many of the\nHRA methods have issues that have led to inconsistencies, insufficient\ntraceability and reproducibility in both the qualitative and quantitative\nphases. Given the need to assess human error in the context of the oil\nindustry, it is necessary to evaluate available HRA methodologies and assess\nits applicability to petroleum operations. Furthermore, it is fundamental to\nassess these methods against good practices of HRA and the requirements for\nadvanced HRA methods. The present paper accomplishes this by analyzing seven\nHRA methods. The evaluation of the methods was performed in three stages. The\nfirst stage consisted of an evaluation of the degree of adaptability of the\nmethod for the Oil and Gas industry. In the second stage the methods were\nevaluated against desirable items in an HRA method. The higher-ranked methods\nwere evaluated, in the third stage, against requirements for advanced HRA\nmethods. In addition to the methods' evaluation, this paper presents an\noverview of state-of-the-art discussions on HRA, led by the Nuclear industry\ncommunity. It remarks that these discussions must be seriously considered in\ndefining a technical roadmap to a credible HRA method for the Oil and Gas\nindustry.",

    "title": "A method to estimate well flowing gas-oil ratio and composition using pressure and temperature measurements across a production choke, a seed composition of oil and gas, and a thermodynamic simulator",
    "abstract": "In this work we propose and demonstrate a method to estimate the flowing\ngas-oil ratio and composition of a hydrocarbon well stream using measurements\nof pressure and temperature across a production choke. The method consists of\nusing a numerical solver on a thermodynamic simulator to recombine a seed oil\nand gas until the simulated temperature drop across the choke is equal to the\nmeasured value. This method is meant for cases where it is not possible to\nmeasure periodically individual well composition. A study case and reference\nsolution were generated using the reservoir model presented in the SPE (Society\nof Petroleum Engineers) comparative case Nr. 5 linked with a process simulator.\nTime profiles of well producing gas-oil ratio, wellstream compositions,\ncompositions of surface conditions oil and gas, and temperature drop across the\nchoke were generated with the models. The method proposed was then employed to\nestimate the flowing gas-oil ratio of the reference solution. Results show that\nthe proposed method predicts with reasonable accuracy (maximum 12% percent\nerror) the well gas-oil ratio and compositions during the life of the field\nwhen using compositions of surface oil and gas from initial time. When using\ncompositions of surface oil and gas from later times, the prediction accuracy\nof the gas-oil ratio improves at those times but worsens for times before and\nafter. A measurement error for the temperature drop across the choke of at\nleast 0.01 {\\deg}C is required to achieve convergence of the method. The mean\npercent error between the predicted and real mole fractions has an upper bound\nin time of 21% when using initial surface oil and gas as seed compositions.",

    "abstract": "The decarbonization of many heavy power-consuming industries is dependent on\nthe integration of renewable energy sources and energy storage systems in\nisolated autonomous power systems. The optimal energy management in such\nschemes becomes harder due to the increased complexity and stability\nrequirements, the rapidly varying operating conditions and uncertainty of\nrenewable sources, the conflicting objectives across different timescales, the\nlimited amount of reliable power sources and energy storage. The state of\ncharge management when energy storage is used for multiple services, such as\noptimal scheduling and frequency support, is one of the most notorious problems\nin this context. To address this issue, an optimal energy management system is\nproposed in this paper. It co-optimizes the primary frequency control layer and\nthe dispatch schedule of conventional generators and energy storage by taking\nadvantage of an algorithm that provides adaptive active power demand\nuncertainty quantification, theoretical guarantees for frequency stability, and\nbounds for the reserves for frequency support assigned to the energy storage\nsystem. A convex reformulation is derived enabling the efficient solution of\nthe involved optimization problem, being a test case of an isolated offshore\noil and gas platform presented for validation.",

    "title": "An Ontological Metamodel for Cyber-Physical System Safety, Security, and Resilience Coengineering",
    "abstract": "System complexity has become ubiquitous in the design, assessment, and\nimplementation of practical and useful cyber-physical systems. This increased\ncomplexity is impacting the management of models necessary for designing\ncyber-physical systems that are able to take into account a number of\n``-ilities'', such that they are safe and secure and ultimately resilient to\ndisruption of service. We propose an ontological metamodel for system design\nthat augments an already existing industry metamodel to capture the\nrelationships between various model elements and safety, security, and\nresilient considerations. Employing this metamodel leads to more cohesive and\nstructured modeling efforts with an overall increase in scalability, usability,\nand unification of already existing models. In turn, this leads to a\nmission-oriented perspective in designing security defenses and resilience\nmechanisms to combat undesirable behaviors. We illustrate this metamodel in an\nopen-source GraphQL implementation, which can interface with a number of\nmodeling languages. We support our proposed metamodel with a detailed\ndemonstration using an oil and gas pipeline model.",

In addition, OEHs\nmay provide decarbonised energy supply for maritime transport, oil and gas\nrecovery, and offshore farming while also enabling conversion and temporary\nstorage of liquefied decarbonised energy carriers for export. Here, we\ninvestigate the role of OEHs in the transition of the Norwegian continental\nshelf energy system towards zero-emission energy supply. We develop a\nmixed-integer linear programming model for investment planning and operational\noptimisation to achieve decarbonisation at minimum costs. We consider clean\ntechnologies, including offshore wind, offshore solar, OEHs and subsea cables.\nWe conduct sensitivity analysis on CO$_2$ tax, CO$_2$ budget and the capacity\nof power from shore. The results show that (a) a hard carbon cap is necessary\nfor stimulating a zero-emission offshore energy system; (b) offshore wind\nintegration and power from shore can more than halve current emissions, but\nOEHs with storage are necessary for zero-emission production and (c) at certain\nCO$_2$ tax levels, the system with OEHs can potentially reduce CO$_2$ emissions\nby 50% and energy losses by 10%, compared to a system with only offshore\nrenewables, gas turbines and power from shore.",

    "title": "The application of Nano-silica gel in sealing well micro-annuli and cement channeling",
    "abstract": "The possibility for hydrocarbon fluids to migrate through debonded\nmicro-annuli wells is a major concern in the petroleum industry. With effective\npermeability of 0.1-1.0 mD, the existence of channels in a cement annulus with\napertures of 10-300 micrometer constitutes a major threat. Squeeze cement is\ntypically difficult to repair channels-leakage with small apertures; hence, a\nlow-viscosity sealer that can be inserted into these channels while producing a\nlong-term resilient seal is sought. A novel application using nano-silica\nsealants could be the key to seal these channels. In the construction and\nsealing of hydrocarbon wells, cementing is a critical phase. Cement is prone to\ncracking during the life cycle of a well because of the changes in downhole\nconditions. The usage of micro-sized cross-linked nano-silica gel as a sealant\nmaterial to minimize damaged cement sheaths is investigated in this study.\nFluid leakage through channels in the cement was investigated using an\nexperimental system. With a diameter of 0.05 inches, the impact of the cement\nchannel size was explored. The sealing efficiency increased from 86 percent to\n95 percent when the nano-silica concentration of the sealing gel increased from\n13 percent to 25 percent. This demonstrates that the concentration of\nnano-silica in the sealing gel affects the gel's ability to seal against fluid\nflow. This research proposes a new way for improving cement zonal isolation and\nthereby lowering the impact of cement failure in the oil and gas industry.",

    "abstract": "Syntactic foams are a promising candidate for applications in marine and oil\nand gas industries in underwater cables and pipelines due to their excellent\ninsulation properties. The effective transmission of electrical energy through\ncables requires insulation materials with a low loss factor and low dielectric\nconstant. Similarly, in transporting fluid through pipelines, thermal\ninsulation is crucial. However, both applications are susceptible to potential\nenvironmental degradation from moisture exposure, which can significantly\nimpact the material's properties. This study addresses the knowledge gap by\nexamining the implications of prolonged moisture exposure on TPU and\nTPU-derived syntactic foam via various multi-scale materials characterization\nmethods. The research focuses on a flexible syntactic foam created using\nselective laser sintering and thermoplastic polyurethane elastomer (TPU)\nreinforced with glass microballoons (GMB). The study specifically explores the\nimpact of moisture exposure duration and GMB volume fraction on microphase\nmorphological changes, their associated mechanisms, and their influence on\nthermal transport and dielectric properties.",

    "abstract": "Industry 4.0 operates based on IoT devices, sensors, and actuators,\ntransforming the use of computing resources and software solutions in diverse\nsectors. Various Industry 4.0 latency-sensitive applications function based on\nmachine learning to process sensor data for automation and other industrial\nactivities. Sending sensor data to cloud systems is time consuming and\ndetrimental to the latency constraints of the applications, thus, fog computing\nis often deployed. Executing these applications across heterogeneous fog\nsystems demonstrates stochastic execution time behavior that affects the task\ncompletion time. We investigate and model various Industry 4.0 ML-based\napplications' stochastic executions and analyze them. Industries like oil and\ngas are prone to disasters requiring coordination of various latency-sensitive\nactivities. Hence, fog computing resources can get oversubscribed due to the\nsurge in the computing demands during a disaster. We propose federating nearby\nfog computing systems and forming a fog federation to make remote Industry 4.0\nsites resilient against the surge in computing demands. We propose a\nstatistical resource allocation method across fog federation for\nlatency-sensitive tasks. Many of the modern Industry 4.0 applications operate\nbased on a workflow of micro-services that are used alone within an industrial\nsite. As such, industry 4.0 solutions need to be aware of applications'\narchitecture, particularly monolithic vs. micro-service. Therefore, we propose\na probability-based resource allocation method that can partition micro-service\nworkflows across fog federation to meet their latency constraints. Another\nconcern in Industry 4.0 is the data privacy of the federated fog. As such, we\npropose a solution based on federated learning to train industrial ML\napplications across federated fog systems without compromising the data\nconfidentiality.",

    "title": "Material Hardness Descriptor Derived by Symbolic Regression",
    "abstract": "Hardness is a materials' property with implications in several industrial\nfields, including oil and gas, manufacturing, and others. However, the\nrelationship between this macroscale property and atomic (i.e., microscale)\nproperties is unknown and in the last decade several models have unsuccessfully\ntried to correlate them in a wide range of chemical space. The understanding of\nsuch relationship is of fundamental importance for discovery of harder\nmaterials with specific characteristics to be employed in a wide range of\nfields. In this work, we have found a physical descriptor for Vickers hardness\nusing a symbolic-regression artificial-intelligence approach based on\ncompressed sensing. SISSO (Sure Independence Screening plus Sparsifying\nOperator) is an artificial-intelligence algorithm used for discovering simple\nand interpretable predictive models. It performs feature selection from up to\nbillions of candidates obtained from several primary features by applying a set\nof mathematical operators. The resulting sparse SISSO model accurately\ndescribes the target property (i.e., Vickers hardness) with minimal complexity.\nWe have considered the experimental values of hardness for binary, ternary, and\nquaternary transition-metal borides, carbides, nitrides, carbonitrides,\ncarboborides, and boronitrides of 61 materials, on which the fitting was\nperformed. The found descriptor is a non-linear function of the microscopic\nproperties, with the most significant contribution being from a combination of\nVoigt-averaged bulk modulus, Poisson's ratio, and Reuss-averaged shear modulus.\nResults of high-throughput screening of 635 candidate materials using the found\ndescriptor suggest the enhancement of material's hardness through mixing with\nharder yet metastable structures (e.g., metastable VN, TaN, ReN$_2$,\nCr$_3$N$_4$, and ZrB$_6$ all exhibit high hardness).",

It also forms inside the oil and gas\npipes leading to higher pumping cost, flow blockage and even catastrophic\naccidents. Engineered surfaces with low hydrate adhesion can provide an\neffective solution to this problem. Liquid impregnated surfaces is one such\nexample of engineered surfaces which has already shown tremendous potential in\nreducing the nucleation and adhesion of solids. Here we report the design and\nsynthesis of liquid impregnated surfaces with extremely low hydrate adhesion\nunder the mixed environment of oil and water. The most challenging aspect of\ndesigning these surfaces was to stabilize a lubricant layer simultaneously\nunder the water and oil. A detailed methodology to make such lubricant stable\nsurfaces from theoretical perspective was described and experimentally\nvalidated for lubricant stability.

    "title": "A Review on Response Strategies in Infrastructure Network Restoration",
    "abstract": "This paper reviews the literature on response strategies for restoring\ninfrastructure networks in the aftermath of a disaster. Our motivation for this\nreview is twofold. First, the frequency and magnitude of natural and man-made\ndisasters (e.g., wild fires, tornadoes, global pandemics, terrorist attacks)\nhave been increasing. These events disrupt the operation of infrastructure\nnetworks, preventing the delivery of vital goods and services such as power and\nfood. Therefore, it is critical to understand the state-of-the-art in\nresponding to network disruptions in order to develop efficient strategies to\nmitigate their impacts. Second, it is critical to enable timely decisions in a\nrapidly changing and unpredictable environment while accounting for numerous\ninterrelated factors. Because the vast majority of response decision problems\nare computationally challenging, quickly finding solutions that are compatible\nwith real-time decision making is a difficult task. Hence, it is important to\nunderstand the nature of response activities and decisions, as well as the\navailable solution methodologies and inherent trade-offs between computation\ntime and solution quality. We review quantitative response methodologies\ndeveloped for infrastructure network restoration, classifying relevant studies\nbased on the properties of the underlying network. In particular, we focus on\nresource allocation, scheduling, routing and repair efforts within the domain\nof power, road, and water, oil and gas network restoration. We also discuss\nopen research questions and future research directions.",

    "title": "Elastic Properties of Confined Fluids from Molecular Modeling to Ultrasonic Experiments on Porous Solids",
    "abstract": "Fluids confined in nanopores are ubiquitous in nature and technology. In\nrecent years, the interest in confined fluids has grown, driven by research on\nunconventional hydrocarbon resources -- shale gas and shale oil, much of which\nare confined in nanopores. When fluids are confined in nanopores, many of their\nproperties differ from those of the same fluid in the bulk. These properties\ninclude density, freezing point, transport coefficients, thermal expansion\ncoefficient, and elastic properties. The elastic moduli of a fluid confined in\nthe pores contribute to the overall elasticity of the fluid-saturated porous\nmedium and determine the speed at which elastic waves traverse through the\nmedium. Wave propagation in fluid-saturated porous media is pivotal for\ngeophysics, as elastic waves are used for characterization of formations and\nrock samples. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of experimental\nworks on wave propagation in fluid-saturated nanoporous media, as well as\ntheoretical works focused on calculation of compressibility of fluids in\nconfinement. We discuss models that bridge the gap between experiments and\ntheory, revealing a number of open questions that are both fundamental and\napplied in nature. While some results were demonstrated both experimentally and\ntheoretically (e.g. the pressure dependence of compressibility of fluids),\nothers were theoretically predicted, but not verified in experiments (e.g.\nlinear scaling of modulus with the pore size). Therefore, there is a demand for\nthe combined experimental-modeling studies on porous samples with various\ncharacteristic pore sizes. The extension of molecular simulation studies from\nsimple model fluids to the more complex molecular fluids is another open area\nof practical interest.",

    "title": "Unsupervised Spatio-Temporal State Estimation for Fine-grained Adaptive Anomaly Diagnosis of Industrial Cyber-physical Systems",
    "abstract": "Accurate detection and diagnosis of abnormal behaviors such as network\nattacks from multivariate time series (MTS) are crucial for ensuring the stable\nand effective operation of industrial cyber-physical systems (CPS). However,\nexisting researches pay little attention to the logical dependencies among\nsystem working states, and have difficulties in explaining the evolution\nmechanisms of abnormal signals. To reveal the spatio-temporal association\nrelationships and evolution mechanisms of the working states of industrial CPS,\nthis paper proposes a fine-grained adaptive anomaly diagnosis method (i.e.\nMAD-Transformer) to identify and diagnose anomalies in MTS. MAD-Transformer\nfirst constructs a temporal state matrix to characterize and estimate the\nchange patterns of the system states in the temporal dimension. Then, to better\nlocate the anomalies, a spatial state matrix is also constructed to capture the\ninter-sensor state correlation relationships within the system. Subsequently,\nbased on these two types of state matrices, a three-branch structure of\nseries-temporal-spatial attention module is designed to simultaneously capture\nthe series, temporal, and space dependencies among MTS. Afterwards, three\nassociated alignment loss functions and a reconstruction loss are constructed\nto jointly optimize the model. Finally, anomalies are determined and diagnosed\nby comparing the residual matrices with the original matrices. We conducted\ncomparative experiments on five publicly datasets spanning three application\ndomains (service monitoring, spatial and earth exploration, and water\ntreatment), along with a petroleum refining simulation dataset collected by\nourselves. The results demonstrate that MAD-Transformer can adaptively detect\nfine-grained anomalies with short duration, and outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art baselines in terms of noise robustness and localization\nperformance.",

    "title": "A Review on Hydrogen Production Technologies and Its Future Demand",
    "abstract": "Hydrogen production is a vital process in the quest for decarbonization and a\nsustainable future. This conversation explores the various technologies used in\nhydrogen production, such as steam methane reforming, electrolysis, and biomass\ngasification. These methods have different applications and efficiencies, but\nall contribute to the production of hydrogen gas. The future of hydrogen\nproduction looks promising, as it offers a clean and versatile energy source\nthat can be used in various sectors, including transportation, industry, and\npower generation. The increasing demand for hydrogen in these sectors, coupled\nwith the global push for decarbonization, highlights the importance of\nadvancing hydrogen production technologies and infrastructure. This paper\nfocuses broadly on different methods of hydrogen production like steam methane\nreforming, electrolysis, and biomass gasification. Steam methane reforming is\ncurrently the most common method, accounting for about 95% of global hydrogen\nproduction. Electrolysis is another method that uses electricity to split water\ninto hydrogen and oxygen. Biomass gasification involves converting organic\nmaterials into hydrogen gas through a thermochemical process. The renewable\nenergy sources considered are water and biomass and the methods considered are\nElectrolysis (grid), thermolysis, thermochemical water splitting,\nphotoelectrochemical water splitting, and gasification. Electrolysis of water\nto produce hydrogen accounts for about 5% of the total hydrogen production.\nStatistically, global hydrogen production reached about USD 155.35 billion in\n2022, with the majority of it being used in the petroleum refining and ammonia\nproduction industries. As for applications, hydrogen can be used as a fuel for\nfuel cell vehicles, as a feedstock for chemical processes, and as a storage\nmedium for renewable energy.",

    "abstract": "The technical and economic feasibility to deliver sustainable liquid biocrude\nthrough hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) while enabling negative carbon dioxide\nemissions is evaluated in this paper, looking into the potential of the process\nin the context of negative emission technologies (NETs) for climate change\nmitigation. In the HTL process, a gas phase consisting mainly of carbon dioxide\nis obtained as a side product driving a potential for the implementation of\ncarbon capture and storage in the process (BECCS) that has not been explored\nyet in the existing literature and is undertaken in this study. To this end,\nthe process is divided in a standard HTL base and a carbon capture add-on,\nhaving forestry residues as feedstock. The Selexol technology is adapted in a\nnovel scheme to simultaneously separate the CO2 from the HTL gas and recover\nthe excess hydrogen for biocrude upgrading. The cost evaluation indicates that\nthe additional cost of the carbon capture can be compensated by revenues from\nthe excess process heat and the European carbon allowance market. The impact in\nthe MFSP of the HTL base case ranges from -7% to 3%, with -15% in the most\nfavorable scenario, with a GHG emissions reduction potential of 102-113%\ncompared to the fossil baseline. These results show that the implementation of\nCCS in the HTL process is a promising alternative from technical, economic and\nenvironmental perspective in future scenarios in which advanced liquid biofuels\nand NETs are expected to play a role in the decarbonization of the energy\nsystem.",

    "abstract": "The EU targets 10 Mt of green hydrogen production by 2030, but has not\ncommitted to targets for 2040. Green hydrogen competes with carbon capture and\nstorage, biomass and imports in reaching emissions reductions; earlier studies\nhave demonstrated the great uncertainty in future cost-optimal development of\ngreen hydrogen. In spite of this, we show that Europe risks little by setting\ngreen hydrogen production targets at around 25 Mt by 2040. Employing an\nextensive scenario analysis combined with novel near-optimal techniques, we\nfind that this target results in systems that are within 10% of cost-optimal in\nmost considered scenarios. Setting concrete targets is important in order to\nresolve significant uncertainty which hampers investments. Targeting green\nhydrogen reduces the dependence on carbon capture and storage and green fuel\nimports, making for a more robust European climate strategy.",

    "title": "Well Cement Degradation and Wellbore Integrity in Geological CO2 Storages: A Literature Review",
    "abstract": "Carbon capture and storage (CCS) has emerged as the most effective method to\ncurb the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. It can store up to 5 billion tons\nof CO2 per year. To guarantee a safe and economical geological storage, the\nwell cement degradation and wellbore integrity need to be studied thoroughly.\nThis review paper is designed to provide a fundamental background of well\ncement degradation and wellbore integrity in geological CO2 storages to support\nthe researchers in further investigation. The review mainly focuses on\nmechanical, thermal, chemical property changes and corrosion time for cement in\nexperiments and simulation during geological CO2 storage. However, the\ndebonding interface between casing/cement or cement/formation has not been\naddressed profoundly. A further investigation should inspect how pressure,\ntemperature, and chemical reaction affect the micro-annuli of casing/cement or\ncement/formation. Also, a mathe-matical model should be established to predict\nthe corrosion rate in geological CO2 storage.",

    "abstract": "Deep Geothermal Energy, Carbon Capture and Storage, and Hydrogen Storage hold\nconsiderable promise for meeting the energy sector's large-scale requirements\nand reducing CO$_2$ emissions. However, the injection of fluids into the\nEarth's crust, essential for these activities, can induce or trigger\nearthquakes. In this paper, we highlight a new approach based on Reinforcement\nLearning for the control of human-induced seismicity in the highly complex\nenvironment of an underground reservoir. This complex system poses significant\nchallenges in the control design due to parameter uncertainties and unmodeled\ndynamics. We show that the reinforcement learning algorithm can interact\nefficiently with a robust controller, by choosing the controller parameters in\nreal-time, reducing human-induced seismicity and allowing the consideration of\nfurther production objectives, \\textit{e.g.}, minimal control power.\nSimulations are presented for a simplified underground reservoir under various\nenergy demand scenarios, demonstrating the reliability and effectiveness of the\nproposed control-reinforcement learning approach.",

    "abstract": "Delivering low-carbon heat will require the substitution of natural gas with\nlow-carbon alternatives such as electricity and hydrogen. The objective of this\npaper is to develop a method to soft-link two advanced, investment-optimising\nenergy system models, RTN (Resource-Technology Network) and WeSIM\n(Whole-electricity System Investment Model), in order to assess cost-efficient\nheat decarbonisation pathways for the UK while utilising the respective\nstrengths of the two models. The linking procedure included passing on hourly\nelectricity prices from WeSIM as input to RTN, and returning capacities and\nlocations of hydrogen generation and shares of electricity and hydrogen in heat\nsupply from RTN to WeSIM. The outputs demonstrate that soft-linking can improve\nthe quality of the solution, while providing useful insights into the\ncost-efficient pathways for zero-carbon heating. Quantitative results point to\nthe cost-effectiveness of using a mix of electricity and hydrogen technologies\nfor delivering zero-carbon heat, also demonstrating a high level of interaction\nbetween electricity and hydrogen infrastructure in a zero-carbon system.\nHydrogen from gas reforming with carbon capture and storage can play a\nsignificant role in the medium term, while remaining a cost-efficient option\nfor supplying peak heat demand in the longer term, with the bulk of heat demand\nbeing supplied by electric heat pumps.",

    "abstract": "The transition to a deeply decarbonized energy system requires coordinated\nplanning of infrastructure investments and operations serving multiple end-uses\nwhile considering technology and policy-enabled interactions across sectors.\nElectricity and natural gas (NG), which are vital vectors of today's energy\nsystem, are likely to be coupled in different ways in the future, resulting\nfrom increasing electrification, adoption of variable renewable energy (VRE)\ngeneration in the power sector and policy factors such as cross-sectoral\nemissions trading. This paper develops a least-cost investment and operations\nmodel for joint planning of electricity and NG infrastructures that considers a\nwide range of available and emerging technology options across the two vectors,\nincluding carbon capture and storage (CCS) equipped power generation,\nlow-carbon drop-in fuels (LCDF) as well as long-duration energy storage (LDES).\nThe model incorporates the main operational constraints of both systems and\nallows each system to operate under different temporal resolutions consistent\nwith their typical scheduling timescales. We apply the modeling framework to\nevaluate power-NG system outcomes for the U.S. New England region under\ndifferent technology, decarbonization goals, and demand scenarios. Under a\nglobal emissions constraint, ranging between 80-95\\% emissions reduction\ncompared to 1990 levels, the least-cost solution disproportionately relies on\nusing the available emissions budget to serve non-power NG demand and results\nin the power sector using only 15-43\\% of the emissions budget.",

    "abstract": "The electrification of transportation is critical to mitigate Greenhouse Gas\n(GHG) emissions. The United States (U.S.) government's Inflation Reduction Act\n(IRA) of 2022 introduces policies to promote the electrification of\ntransportation. In addition to electrifying transportation, clean energy\ntechnologies such as Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) may play a major role in\nachieving a net-zero energy system. Utilizing scenarios simulated by the U.S.\nversion of the Global Change Analysis Model (GCAM-USA), we analyze the\nindividual and compound contributions of the IRA and CCS to reach a clean U.S.\ngrid by 2035 and net-zero GHG emissions by 2050. We analyze the contributions\nbased on three metrics: i) transportation electrification rate, ii)\ntransportation fuel mix, and iii) spatio-temporal charging loads. Our findings\nindicate that the IRA significantly accelerates transportation electrification\nin the near-term (until 2035). In contrast, CCS technologies, by enabling the\ncontinued use of internal combustion vehicles while still advancing torward\nnet-zero, potentially suppresses the rate of transportation electrification in\nthe long-term. This study underscores how policy and technology innovation can\ninteract and sensitivity studies with different combination are essential to\ncharacterize the potential contributions of each to the transportation\nelectrification.",

    "title": "An Assessment of the UK Government Clean Energy Strategy for the Year 2030",
    "abstract": "In 2024, the UK Government made two striking announcements on its plans to\ndecarbonise the energy system; it pledged GBP22 billion to establish carbon\ncapture and storage hubs on Teesside and Merseyside and released the Clean\nPower 2030 Action Plan. This paper questions the validity of both plans,\narguing that they do not take adequate account of the consequences of the\nhighly variable nature of wind and solar generations. Using dynamic models of\nfuture UK electricity systems which are designed to take account of these\nvariabilities, it is shown that the Clean Power 2030 Action Plan overestimates\nthe ability of wind and solar generations to decarbonise the electricity system\nas they increase in size relative to the demand of the electricity system. More\nimportantly, the dynamic models show that most of the achievable\ndecarbonization is the result of increasing wind generation from the current\nlevel of around 10 GW to around 20 GW. Increasing wind generation to only 20\nGW, rather than to 30 GW as proposed in the Action Plan, should halve the\nproposed cost, a saving of perhaps GBP 120 billion, with little disbenefit in\nterms of reduced decarbonization. Furthermore, the dynamic modelling shows that\nUK gas storage capacity of 7.5 winter days looks hopeless inadequate in\ncomparison with the storage capacities deemed necessary by its continental\nneighbors. Concern is expressed that a consequence of the Climate Change Act of\n2008 requiring the UK to meet arbitrary decarbonization targets is leading\ngovernment advisors to propose several unproven and therefore highly risky\ntechnological solutions.",

Carbon\ndioxide (CO 2 ) concentration in the Earth's atmosphere is linked to the\naverage temperature on the surface of the planet. Carbon capture and storage is\nan important technological endeavor aiming to improve the ecology. The present\nwork investigates reaction paths that are responsible for CO 2 chemisorption by\nthe ammonium- and phosphonium-based ionic liquids containing an aprotic\nheterocyclic anion 2-cyanopyrrolidine. We show that two moles of CO 2 per one\nmole of the gas scavenger can be theoretically fixed by such ionic liquids.\nBoth the cation and anion participate in the chemisorption. The corresponding\nstandard enthalpies are moderately negative. The barriers of all reactions\ninvolving the phosphonium-based cation are relatively small and favor practical\napplications of the considered sorbents. The performance of the ammonium-based\ncation is less favorable due to the inherent instability of the\ntetraalkylammonium ylide. The role is phosphonium ylide in the mechanism of the\nreaction is carefully characterized.

This paper discusses\nresults obtained with the real-time equation-of-motion CC cumulant approach\n(RT-EOM-CC), and CC Green's function (CCGF) approaches in applications to the\nwater and water dimer molecules. We compare the ionization potentials obtained\nwith these methods for the valence region with the results obtained with the\nCCSD(T) formulation as a difference of energies for N and N-1 electron systems.\nAll methods show good agreement with each other. They also agree well with\nexperiment, with errors usually below 0.1 eV for the ionization potentials. We\nalso analyze unique features of the spectral functions, associated with the\nposition of satellite peaks, obtained with the RT-EOM-CC and CCGF methods\nemploying single and double excitations, as a function of the monomer OH bond\nlength and the proton transfer coordinate in the dimer. Finally, we analyze the\nimpact of the basis set effects on the quality of calculated ionization\npotentials and find that the basis set effects are less pronounced for the\naugmented-type sets.",

    "abstract": "We have developed and benchmarked a new extended basis set for explicitly\ncorrelated calculations, namely cc-pV5Z-F12. It is offered in two variants,\ncc-pV5Z-F12 and cc- pV5Z-F12(rev2), the latter of which has additional basis\nfunctions on hydrogen not present in the cc-pVnZ-F12 (n=D,T,Q) sequence.A large\nuncontracted 'reference' basis set is used for benchmarking. cc-pVnZ-F12 (n=D,\nT, Q, 5) is shown to be a convergent hierarchy. Especially the cc-\npV5Z-F12(rev2) basis set can yield the valence CCSD component of total\natomization energies (TAEs), without any extrapolation, to an accuracy normally\nassociated with aug-cc-pV{5,6}Z extrapolations. SCF components are functionally\nat the basis set limit, while the MP2 limit can be approached to as little as\n0.01 kcal/mol without extrapolation. The determination of (T) appears to be the\nmost difficult of the three components and cannot presently be accomplished\nwithout extrapolation or scaling. (T) extrapolation from cc-pV{T,Q}Z-F12 basis\nsets, combined with CCSD-F12b/cc-pV5Z-F12 calculations appears to be an\naccurate combination for explicitly correlated thermochemistry. For accurate\nwork on noncovalent interactions, basis set superposition error with the\ncc-pV5Z-F12 basis set is shown to be so small that counterpoise corrections can\nbe neglected for all but the most exacting purposes.",

    "abstract": "In the face of escalating climate change, achieving significant reductions in\ngreenhouse gas emissions from hard-to-abate industrial sectors is imperative.\nCarbon Capture and Storage (CCS) represents an essential technological\nadvancement to achieve sustainable decarbonization. This manuscript reports on\nthe bilateral CCS network between Norway and Poland, designed and implemented\nto leverage their capabilities to expedite technology deployment via mutual\ncooperation and accelerate CCS initiatives targeted to member states'\nchallenges across Europe, aiming for a meaningful contribution to climate\ngoals. Norway is renowned for its operational acumen, as demonstrated by\nlandmark projects like Sleipner and Snohvit, and its forward-looking\ninitiatives, such as the open-source cross-border Northern Lights project,\nwhich offer advanced infrastructure and expertise. Conversely, Poland,\ncharacterized by its coal-dependent economy and the challenge of decarbonizing\nextensive industrial emissions, presents a significant geological CO2 storage\npotential, estimated at over 15.5 gigatonnes. This study delves into the\npotential synergies derived from collaborative endeavors in academic education,\nresearch and development, industrial implementation, regulatory coherence, and\npublic engagement. By underscoring the reciprocal benefits of such partnership,\nthe study underscores the indispensable role of bilateral cooperation in\nharnessing CCS's capabilities to meet the EU's ambitious climate objectives,\npaving the way toward a sustainable and low-carbon future. Additionally, it\noutlines a scalable model for fostering and supporting broader bilateral and\nmulti-lateral collaborations, emphasizing the pivotal role of interconnected\nnetworks in shaping effective global climate action strategies.",

    "abstract": "The digitalization of railway systems should increase the efficiency of the\ntrain operation to achieve future mobility challenges and climate goals. But\nthis digitalization also comes with several new challenges in providing a\nsecure and reliable train operation. The work resulting in this paper tackles\ntwo major challenges. First, there is no single university curriculum combining\ncomputer science, railway operation, and certification processes. Second, many\nrailway processes are still manual and without the usage of digital tools and\nresult in static implementations and configurations of the railway\ninfrastructure devices. This case study occurred as part of the Digital Rail\nSummer School 2021, a university course combining the three mentioned aspects\nas cooperation of several German universities with partners from the railway\nindustry. It passes through all steps from a digital Control-Command and\nSignalling (CCS) planning in ProSig 7.3, the transfer, and validation of the\nplanning in the PlanPro data format and toolbox, to the generation of code of\nan interlocking for the digital CCS planning to contribute to the vision of\ntest automation. This paper contributes the experiences of the case study and a\nproof-of-concept of the whole lifecycle for the Digital Testfield of Deutsche\nBahn in Scheibenberg. This proof-of-concept will be continued in ongoing and\nfollowing projects to fulfill the vision of test automation and automated\nlaunching of new devices.",

    "abstract": "An accurate determination of singlet-triplet gaps in biradicals, including\ncyclobutadiene in the automerization barrier region where one has to balance\nthe substantial nondynamical many-electron correlation effects characterizing\nthe singlet ground state with the predominantly dynamical correlations of the\nlowest-energy triplet, remains a challenge for many quantum chemistry methods.\nHigh-level coupled-cluster (CC) approaches, such as the CC method with a full\ntreatment of singly, doubly, and triply excited clusters (CCSDT), are often\ncapable of providing reliable results, but the routine application of such\nmethods is hindered by their high computational costs. We have recently\nproposed a practical alternative to converging the CCSDT energetics at small\nfractions of the computational effort, even when electron correlations become\nstronger and connected triply excited clusters are larger and nonperturbative,\nby merging the CC($P$;$Q$) moment expansions with the selected configuration\ninteraction methodology abbreviated as CIPSI. We demonstrate that one can\naccurately approximate the highly accurate CCSDT potential surfaces\ncharacterizing the lowest singlet and triplet states of cyclobutadiene along\nthe automerization coordinate and the gap between them using tiny fractions of\ntriply excited cluster amplitudes identified with the help of relatively\ninexpensive CIPSI Hamiltonian diagonalizations.",

We hope that this lens design\ncan be used to improve all 100 keV electron microscopes designed for\nsingle-particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryoEM).",

These CC($P$;$Q$)\nmethodologies are applied, alongside their completely renormalized (CR)\ncoupled-cluster (CC) and equation-of-motion (EOM) CC counterparts, to recover\nthe ground- and excited-state potential cuts of the water molecule along the\nO-H bond-breaking coordinate obtained in the parent CC/EOMCC calculations with\na full treatment of singles, doubles, and triples (CCSDT/EOMCCSDT).

It is shown that the R3c space group\nfor the superlattice phase cannot correctly account for the peak positions of\nthe superlattice reflections present in the neutron diffraction patterns. The\ncorrect space group is reconfirmed to be Cc. A comparison of the atomic\ncoordinates of Cc and Cm space groups is also presented to show that in the\nabsence of superlattice reflections, as is the case with XRD data, one would\nland up in the Cm space group.

    "abstract": "One of the aspects currently holding back commercial scale deployment of\ncarbon capture and storage (CCS) is an accurate understanding of the\nthermodynamic behaviour of carbon dioxide and relevant impurities during the\npipeline transport stage. In this article we develop a general framework for\nderiving pressure-explicit EoS for impure CO2. This flexible framework\nfacilitates ongoing development of custom EoS in response to new data and\ncomputational applications. We use our method to generalise a recent EoS for\npure CO2 [Demetriades et al. Proc IMechE Part E, 227 (2013) pp. 117] to binary\nmixtures with N2, O2 and H2, obtaining model parameters by fitting to\nexperiments made under conditions relevant to CCS-pipeline transport. Our model\npertains to pressures up to 16MPa and temperatures between 273K and the\ncritical temperature of pure CO2. In this region, we achieve close agreement\nwith experimental data. When compared to the GERG EoS, our EoS has a comparable\nlevel of agreement with CO2 -N2 VLE experiments and demonstrably superior\nagreement with the O2 and H2 VLE data. Finally, we discuss future options to\nimprove the calibration of EoS and to deal with the sparsity of data for some\nimpurities.",

    "abstract": "We have developed a new basis set family, denoted aug-cc-pVnZ-F12 (or\naVnZ-F12 for short), for explicitly correlated calculations. The sets included\nin this family were constructed by supplementing the corresponding cc-pVnZ-F12\nsets with additional diffuse functions on the higher angular momenta (i.e.,\nadditional d-h functions on non-hydrogen atoms, and p-g on hydrogen), optimized\nfor the MP2-F12 energy of the relevant atomic anions. The new basis sets have\nbeen benchmarked against electron affinities of the first- and second-row\natoms, the W4-17 dataset of total atomization energies, the S66 dataset of\nnoncovalent interactions, the BEGDB water clusters subset, and the WATER23\nsubset of the GMTKN24 and GMTKN30 benchmark suites. The aVnZ-F12 basis sets\ndisplayed excellent performance, not just for electron affinities but also for\nnoncovalent interaction energies of neutral and anionic species. Appropriate\nCABS (complementary auxiliary basis sets) were explored for the S66 noncovalent\ninteractions benchmark: between similar-sized basis sets, CABS were found to be\nmore transferable than generally assumed.",

    "abstract": "For the interpretation of spectra of magnetic stellar objects such as\nmagnetic white dwarfs (WDs) highly accurate quantum chemical predictions for\natoms and molecules in finite magnetic field are required. Especially the\naccurate description of electronically excited states and their properties\nrequires established methods such as those from coupled-cluster (CC) theory.\nHowever, respective calculations are computationally challenging even for\nmedium-sized systems. Cholesky decomposition (CD) techniques may be used to\nalleviate memory bottlenecks. In finite-field computations, the latter are\nincreased due to the reduction of permutational symmetry within the\nelectron-repulsion-integrals (ERIs) as well as the need for complex-valued data\ntypes. CD enables a memory-efficient, approximate description of the ERIs with\nrigorous error control and thus the treatment of larger systems at the CC level\nbecomes feasible. In order to treat molecules in a finite magnetic field (ff),\nwe present in this work the working equations of the left and right-hand side\nequations for ff-EOM-CD-CCSD for various EOM flavours as well as for the\napproximate ff-EOM-CD-CC2 method. The methods are applied to the study of the\nmodification of the spectral lines of a magnesium transition by a helium\natmosphere that can be found in magnetic WD stars.",

The multiplet character of the neutron diffraction\nprofiles of (3/2 1/2 1/2)pc (pseudocubic or pc indices) and (3/2 3/2 1/2)pc\nsuperlattice peaks, appearing below the AFD transition temperature, rules out\nthe rhombohedral R3c space group.

    "abstract": "The limited availability of accurate experimental data in wide ranges of\npressure, temperature, and composition is the main constraining factor for the\nproper development and assessment of thermodynamic models and equations of\nstate. In the particular case of carbon capture and storage (CCS) processes,\nthere is a clear need for data sets related to the (carbon dioxide + oxygen)\nmixtures that this work aims to address. This work provides new experimental\n($p$, $\\rho$, $T$) data for three binary ($CO_{2}$ + $O_{2}$) mixtures with\nmole fractions of oxygen $x$($O_{2}$) = (0.05, 0.10, and 0.20) mol/mol, in the\ntemperature range $T$ = (250 to 375) K and pressure range $p$ = (0.5 to 13)\nMPa. The measurements were performed with a high-precision single-sinker\ndensimeter with magnetic suspension coupling. The density data were obtained\nwith estimated expanded relative uncertainties of 0.02% for the highest\ndensities and up to 0.3% for the lowest ones.The results were compared to the\ncorresponding results calculated by the current reference equations of state\nfor this kind of mixtures, namely the EOS-CG (combustion gases) and the\nGERG-2008 equation of state, respectively. The EOS-CG yields better estimations\nin density than the GERG-2008 equation of state. The results from the EOS-GC\nmodel show no systematic temperature dependence. For the GERG-2008 model,\nhowever, this criterion is significantly less fulfilled.",

    "title": "Insurance Contract for High Renewable Energy Integration",
    "abstract": "The increasing penetration of renewable energy poses significant challenges\nto power grid reliability. There have been increasing interests in utilizing\nfinancial tools, such as insurance, to help end-users hedge the potential risk\nof lost load due to renewable energy variability. With insurance, a user pays a\npremium fee to the utility, so that he will get compensated in case his demand\nis not fully satisfied. A proper insurance design needs to resolve the\nfollowing two challenges: (i) users' reliability preference is private\ninformation; and (ii) the insurance design is tightly coupled with the\nrenewable energy investment decision. To address these challenges, we adopt the\ncontract theory to elicit users' private reliability preferences, and we study\nhow the utility can jointly optimize the insurance contract and the planning of\nrenewable energy. A key analytical challenge is that the joint optimization of\nthe insurance design and the planning of renewables is non-convex. We resolve\nthis difficulty by revealing important structural properties of the optimal\nsolution, using the help of two benchmark problems: the no-insurance benchmark\nand the social-optimum benchmark. Compared with the no-insurance benchmark, we\nprove that the social cost and users' total energy cost are always no larger\nunder the optimal contract. Simulation results show that the largest benefit of\nthe insurance contract is achieved at a medium electricity-bill price together\nwith a low type heterogeneity and a high renewable uncertainty.",

    "abstract": "As the proportion of variable inverter-based renewable energy generation in\nelectricity systems increases from a minority to the majority of total supply,\nthe complexity and cost of providing ancillary system services increases in\nparallel. Australia is experiencing this shift now - from having the third most\ncarbon-intensive electricity sector in the world in 2010, to now having\npenetrations of variable renewable energy (VRE) regularly reaching 100 percent\nin some regions, with world-leading uptake of distributed energy resources\n(DER). This paper presents pioneering work exploring new technical, economic\nand regulatory frameworks for the provision of Essential System Services (ESS),\nalso known as ancillary services, in power systems dominated by variable\ninverter-based renewable energy resources. We explore the recent application of\nthe concept of demand curves and nomograms to the procurement of ESS, and\nemerging design principles for frameworks in facilitating the evolution from\ndefault provision of system services by synchronous generation, to\nco-optimisation of services through unit commitment, to independent provision\nof services through inverter based resources. The paper also analyses the\nrecent technical and financial success of the world's largest battery, the\nHornsdale Power Reserve in South Australia, and its ability to inform how\nfuture electricity market frameworks may incentivize and accommodate new\ntechnological capability, both first and Nth of a kind systems. Finally, the\npaper reviews emerging energy system technological capability, including the\nprovision of synthetic inertia and RoCoF control, grid-forming inverters, and\nadvanced DER aggregation in providing ESS and system restart capability for\nsecure, resilient and island-able grids.",

We define the\nClimatological Renewable Energy Deviation Index (CREDI) as the cumulative\nanomaly of a renewable resource with respect to its climate over a specific\ntime period of interest. For this we introduce the smooth, yet physical, hourly\nrolling window climatology that captures the expected hourly to yearly\nbehaviour of renewable resources. We analyse the presented index at decadal,\nannual and (sub-)seasonal timescales for a sample region and discuss scientific\nand practical implications.\n  CREDI is meant as an analytical tool for researchers and stakeholders to help\nthem quantify, understand, and explain, the impact of energy-meteorological\nvariability on future energy system. Improved understanding translates to\nbetter assessments of how renewable resources, and the associated risks for\nenergy security, may fare in current and future climatological settings.

Under mild assumptions, we convert the upper-level\nobjective into an equivalent form using the dual solutions obtained from the\nlower-level operation problems. Additionally, a novel iterative solution\nstrategy is proposed for the newly formulated bilevel program. Under such an\niterative scheme, we show that the upper-level objective is locally linear\nregarding the forecast model output, and can act as the loss function.\nNumerical experiments demonstrate that, compared to commonly used statistical\nquality-oriented point forecasting methods, forecasts obtained by the proposed\napproach result in lower operation costs. Meanwhile, the proposed approach is\nmore computationally efficient than traditional two-stage stochastic programs.",

    "title": "Dual Pricing to Prioritize Renewable Energy and Consumer Preferences in Electricity Markets",
    "abstract": "Electricity markets currently fail to incorporate preferences of buyers,\ntreating polluting and renewable energy sources as having equal social benefit\nunder a system of uniform clearing prices. Meanwhile, renewable energy is prone\nto curtailment due to transmission constraints, forcing grid operators to\nreduce or shut down renewable energy production despite its availability and\nneed. This paper proposes a ``dual pricing mechanism\" which allows buyers to\nbid both their willingness to pay for electricity, and additionally, their\npreference for green energy. Designed for use in deregulated electricity\nmarkets, this mechanism prioritizes the dispatch of more renewable energy\nsources according to consumer preferences. Traditional uniform clearing prices,\nwhich treat all energy sources equally, do not reflect the growing share of\ngreen energy in the power grid and the environmental values of consumers. By\nallowing load-serving entities to bid their willingness to pay for renewable\nenergy directly into the clearing market, our proposed framework generates\ndistinct pricing signals for green and ``black\" electricity.",

    "title": "Double Input Boost/Y-Source DC-DC Converter for Renewable Energy Sources",
    "abstract": "With the increasing adoption of renewable energy sources by domestic users,\ndecentralisation of the grid is fast becoming a reality. Distributed generation\nis an important part of a decentralised grid. This approach employs several\nsmall-scale technologies to produce electrical energy close to the end users or\nconsumers. The higher reliability of these systems proves to be of advantage\nwhen compared to traditional generation systems. Multi-Input Converters (MICs)\nperform a decisive function in Distributed Energy Resources (DERs). Making use\nof such MICs prove to be beneficial in terms of size, cost, number of\ncomponents used, efficiency and reliability as compared to using several\nindependent converters. This thesis proposes a double input DC-DC converter\nwhich makes use of a quasi Y-source converter in tandem with a boost converter.\nThe quasi Y-source converter has the advantage of having a very high gain for\nlow duty cycles. The associated operating modes are analysed and the operation\nof the MIC is verified using simulation result. A hardware prototype is built\nfor large signal analysis in open loop. Different loads are applied and the\nefficiency of the MIC as a whole as well as the load sharing between the\ndifferent sources is investigated.",

It can be rolled up, transported, and attached to\nexisting man-made, or natural structures. It allows the solar energy conversion\nsystem to be low in capital cost and inexpensive to install as it can be\nattached to existing structures since it does not require the construction of a\nsuperstructure of its own. This novel system is uniquely distinct and different\nfrom other solar tracking and focussing processes allowing it to be more\neconomical and practical. Furthermore, in its capacity as a power producer, it\ncan be utilized with far greater safety, simplicity, economy, and efficiency in\nthe conversion of solar energy.",

Based on 40 years of solar-energy data for the\nSt.\\ Louis region, we formulate a statistical model that we use to generate\nsynthetic insolation data over millions of years. We use these data to monitor\nthe energy depletion in the storage system near the winter solstice. From this\ninformation, we develop explicit formulas for the required storage and the\nnature of cost-optimized system configurations as a function of reliability and\nthe excess of generation capacity. Minimizing the cost of the combined\ngeneration and storage system gives the optimal mix of these two constituents.\nFor an annual failure rate of less than 3\\%, it is sufficient to have a solar\ngeneration capacity that slightly exceeds the daily electrical load at the\nwinter solstice, together with a few days of storage.",

Among them, the high light extinction coefficient of\nnanofluids can be useful in linear parabolic concentrating solar systems, while\ntheir properties under high light irradiation intensities can be exploited for\ndirect solar steam generation. The optical characterization of colloids,\nincluding the study of non-linear optical properties, is thus a needed step to\ndesign the use of such novel materials for solar energy exploitation. In this\nwork, we analysed two different types of nanofluids, consisting of\npolycarboxylate chemically modified graphene nanoplatelets (P-GnP) and sulfonic\nacid-functionalized graphene nanoplatelets (S-GnP) dispersed in water, at three\nconcentrations from 0.005 wt% to 0.05 wt%.

    "abstract": "We formulate, solve computationally and study experimentally the problem of\ncollecting solar energy in three dimensions(1-5). We demonstrate that absorbers\nand reflectors can be combined in the absence of sun tracking to build\nthree-dimensional photovoltaic (3DPV) structures that can generate measured\nenergy densities (energy per base area, kWh/m2) higher by a factor of 2-20 than\nstationary flat PV panels, versus an increase by a factor of 1.3-1.8 achieved\nwith a flat panel using dual-axis sun tracking(6). The increased energy density\nis countered by a higher solar cell area per generated energy for 3DPV compared\nto flat panel design (by a factor of 1.5-4 in our conditions), but accompanied\nby a vast range of improvements. 3DPV structures are steadier sources of solar\nenergy generation at all latitudes: they can double the number of peak power\ngeneration hours and dramatically reduce the seasonal, latitude and weather\nvariations of solar energy generation compared to a flat panel design.\nSelf-supporting 3D shapes can create new schemes for PV installation and the\nincreased energy density can facilitate the use of cheaper thin film materials\nin area-limited applications. Our findings suggest that harnessing solar energy\nin three dimensions can open new avenues towards Terawatt-scale generation.",

    "abstract": "Inhibiting ice accumulation on surfaces is an energy-intensive task and is of\nsignificant importance in nature and technology where it has found applications\nin windshields, automobiles, aviation, renewable energy generation, and\ninfrastructure. Existing methods rely on on-site electrical heat generation,\nchemicals, or mechanical removal, with drawbacks ranging from financial costs\nto disruptive technical interventions and environmental incompatibility. Here\nwe focus on applications where surface transparency is desirable and propose\nmetasurfaces with embedded plasmonically enhanced light absorption heating,\nusing ultra-thin hybrid metal-dielectric coatings, as a passive, viable\napproach for de-icing and anti-icing, in which the sole heat source is\nrenewable solar energy. The balancing of transparency and absorption is\nachieved with rationally nano-engineered coatings consisting of gold\nnanoparticle inclusions in a dielectric (titanium dioxide), concentrating\nbroadband absorbed solar energy into a small volume. This causes a > 10 {\\deg}C\ntemperature increase with respect to ambient at the air-solid interface, where\nice is most likely to form, delaying freezing, reducing ice adhesion, when it\noccurs, to negligible levels (de-icing) and inhibiting frost formation\n(anti-icing).

    "abstract": "Solar energy is clean and renewable but has a low flux density. The lack of a\ncontinuous and reliable power supply reduces their average daily output. Since\nthe infrared part is not utilized to produce electricity, conventional\nphotovoltaic cells use only about half of the solar spectrum. Direct radiation\nflux is also necessary for solar Stirling engine to work efficiently. The\nhybrid system can largely overcome these problems. The design combines the\nphotovoltaic and energy storage-integrated Stirling engine or thermal field\nemission technologies in the same concentrating solar power system, providing a\ngreat potential in terms of energy production per unit area. The photovoltaic\ncells can be deposited on the concentrating solar power main mirror to allow\nthe system to collect and convert the diffuse component of the light. The\ndesign allows utilization of existing equipment, particularly a high-grade\nparabolic dish or midgrade Fresnel concentrator for rooftop installation. To\noptimize the use of solar energy, beam splitters thermally decouple the modules\nby splitting the solar spectrum into three spectral ranges and directing\nvisible, ultraviolet and infrared radiation into the photovoltaic cells,\ngate/Cs-filled gap and cavity-type solar receiver, respectively. A\nphoton-enhanced gate electrode creates on the cathode surface an electrostatic\nfield large enough to compensate space charge field and initiates thermal field\nemission process. In the thermal field emission cathodes with nano-structured\nsurfaces, the current density can reach values close to the field emission\nlimit. The design of the electrodes based on nano-structured emission materials\nwere experimentally explored by the co-authors. In these experiments,\nefficiency of heat-to-electricity conversion was investigated and conditions\nfor advanced nano-materials application for harvesting solar energy were found.",

One such case is the\nhigh-temperature sulfurization/selenization in thin film chalcogenide solar\ncells, of which the kesterite Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) is an example. Here, by using\nvery thin (<10 nm) TiN-based diffusion barriers at the interface, with\ndifferent composition and properties, we demonstrate on a device level that the\nprotection of the Si bottom cell is largely dependent on the barrier layer\nengineering. Several monolithic CZTS/Si tandem solar cells with open-circuit\nvoltages (Voc) up to 1.06 V and efficiencies up to 3.9% are achieved,\nindicating a performance comparable to conventional interfacial layers based on\ntransparent conductive oxides, and pointing to a promising alternative design\nin solar energy conversion devices.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a classical estimation problem for calculating the energy\ngenerated by photovoltaic solar energy systems in the Netherlands, on a daily,\nannual and regional basis. We identify two data sources to construct our\nmethodology: pvoutput, an online portal with solar energy yield measurements,\nand modelled irradiance data, from the Royal Netherlands Meteorological\nInstitute. Combining these, we obtain probability functions of observing energy\nyields, given the irradiance, which we then apply to our PV systems database,\nallowing us to calculate daily and annual solar energy yields. We examine the\nvariation in our daily and annual estimates as a result of taking different\nsubsets of pvoutput systems with certain specifications such as orientation,\ntilt and inverter to PV capacity ratio. Hence we obtain specific annual energy\nyields in the range of 877-946 kWh/kWp and 838-899 kWh/kWp for 2016 and 2017\nrespectively. The current method used at Statistics Netherlands assumes this to\nbe 875 kWh/kWp, meaning the yields were underestimated and overestimated for\n2016 and 2017 respectively. Finally, we translate our national estimates into\nsolar energy yields per municipality. This research demonstrates that an\nirradiance based measure of solar energy generation is necessary to obtain more\naccurate energy yields on both a national and regional level.",

While entropy analysis provides a\nparticularly convenient way to understand the efficiency limits, it is\ntypically taught in the context of thermodynamic cycles among quasi-equilibrium\nstates and its generalization to solar energy conversion systems running in a\ncontinuous and non-equilibrium fashion is not straightforward. In this\neducational article, we present a few examples to illustrate how the concept of\nphoton entropy, combined with the radiative transfer equation, can be used to\nanalyze the local entropy generation processes and the efficiency limits of\ndifferent solar energy conversion systems. We provide explicit calculations for\nthe local and total entropy generation rates for simple emitters and absorbers,\nas well as photovoltaic cells, which can be readily reproduced by students.

    "abstract": "Floating photovoltaics (FPV) is an emerging technology that is gaining\nattention worldwide. However, little information is still available on its\npossible impacts in the aquatic ecosystems, as well as on the durability of its\ncomponents. Therefore, this work intends to provide a contribution to this\nfield, analysing possible obstacles that can compromise the performance of this\ntechnology, adding to an increase of its reliability and assessing possible\nimpacts. The problem under study is related to the potential submersion of\nphotovoltaic cables, that can lead to a degradation of its electrical\ninsulation capabilities and, consequently, higher energy production losses and\nwater contamination. In the present study, the submersion of photovoltaic\ncables (with two different insulation materials) in freshwater and artificial\nseawater was tested, in order to replicate real life conditions, when FPV\nsystems are located in reservoirs or in the marine environment. Electrical\ninsulation tests were carried out weekly to assess possible cable degradation,\nthe physical-chemical characteristics of the water were also periodically\nmonitored, complemented by analysis to detect traces of copper and\nmicroplastics in the water. The results showed that the submersion of\nphotovoltaic cables with rubber sheath in saltwater can lead to a cable\naccelerated degradation, with reduction of its electrical insulation and,\nconsequently, copper release into the aquatic environment.",

In this paper, we\npresent a study addressing the impact of haze on the performance pf\nphotovoltaic installations in cities. Using long-term, high resolution field\ndata from Delhi and Singapore we derive an empirical relation between reduction\nin insolation and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentration. This approach\nenables a straightforward way to estimate air pollution related losses to\nphotovoltaic power generation anywhere on the planet. For Delhi, we find that\ninsolation received by silicon PV panels was reduced by 11.5% plus minus 1.5%\nor 200 kWh/m2 per year between 2016 and 2017 due to air pollution. We extended\nthis analysis to 16 more cities around the planet and estimated insolation\nreductions ranging from 2.0% (Singapore) to 9.1% (Beijing). Using spectrum data\nfrom Singapore, we projected how other photovoltaic technologies would be\naffected and found an additional reduction compared to silicon of between 23%\nrelative for GaAs and 42% for a 1.64 eV perovskite material. Considering\ncurrent installation targets and local prices for electricity, we project that\nannual losses in revenue from photovoltaic installations could exceed 20\nmillion USD for Delhi alone, indicating that annual economic damage from air\npollution to photovoltaic site operators and investors worldwide could be\nbillions of dollars.",

    "abstract": "Ferroelectric all-inorganic halide perovskites nanocrystals with both\nspontaneous polarizations and visible light absorption are promising candidates\nfor designing functional ferroelectric photovoltaic devices. Three dimensional\nhalide perovskite nanocrystals have the potential of being ferroelectric, yet\nit remains a challenge to realize ferroelectric photovoltaic devices which can\nbe operated in absence of an external electric field. Here we report that a\npopular all-inorganic halide perovskite nanocrystal, CsPbBr3, exhibits\nferroelectricity driven photovoltaic effect under visible light in absence of\nan external electric field. The ferroelectricity in CsPbBr3 nanocrystals\noriginates from the stereochemical activity in Pb (II) lone pair that promotes\nthe distortion of PbBr6 octahedra. Furthermore, application of an external\nelectric field allows the photovoltaic effect to be enhanced and the\nspontaneous polarization to be switched with the direction of the electric\nfield. Robust fatigue performance, flexibility and prolonged photoresponse\nunder continuous illumination are potentially realized in the zero-bias\nconditions. These finding establishes all-inorganic halide perovskites\nnanocrystals as potential candidates for designing novel photoferroelectric\ndevices by coupling optical functionalities and ferroelectric responses.",

Here, we introduce a concept based on\nthermal energy grid storage (TEGS) using a multijunction photovoltaic heat\nengine (MPV) with promising initial experimental results that could meet the\nlow cost required to enable cost competitive dispatchable renewables. The\napproach exploits an important tradeoff between the accession of an extremely\nlow cost per unit energy stored, by storing heat instead of electricity\ndirectly, while paying the penalty of a lower round trip efficiency. To\nunderstand why this tradeoff is advantageous, we first introduce a framework\nfor evaluating storage technologies that treats round trip efficiency (RTE) as\na variable, in addition to cost per unit energy stored (CPE) and cost per unit\npower (CPP). It is from this perspective that the TEGS-MPV concept offers a\ncompelling economic proposition.",

Here we report on solar cells with active layers made solely of\ncarbon nanomaterials that present the same advantages of conjugated\npolymer-based solar cells - namely solution processable, potentially flexible,\nand chemically tunable - but with significantly increased photostability and\nthe possibility to revert photodegradation. The device active layer composition\nis optimized using ab-initio density functional theory calculations to predict\ntype-II band alignment and Schottky barrier formation. The best device\nfabricated is composed of PC70BM fullerene, semiconducting single-walled carbon\nnanotubes and reduced graphene oxide. It achieves a power conversion efficiency\nof 1.3% - a record for solar cells based on carbon as the active material - and\nshows significantly improved lifetime than a polymer-based device. We calculate\nefficiency limits of up to 13% for the devices fabricated in this work,\ncomparable to those predicted for polymer solar cells. There is great promise\nfor improving carbon-based solar cells considering the novelty of this type of\ndevice, the superior photostability, and the availability of a large number of\ncarbon materials with yet untapped potential for photovoltaics.

    "abstract": "We propose a solar thermal energy conversion system consisting of a solar\nabsorber, a thermoradiative cell or negative illumination photodiode, and a\nphotovoltaic cell. Because it is a heat engine, this system can also be paired\nwith thermal storage to provide reliable electricity generation. Heat from the\nsolar absorber drives radiative recombination current in the thermoradiative\ncell, and its emitted light is absorbed by the photovoltaic cell to provide an\nadditional photocurrent. Based on the principle of detailed balance, we\ncalculate a limiting solar conversion efficiency of 85% for fully concentrated\nsunlight and 45% for one sun with an absorber and single-junction cells of\nequal areas. Ideal and nonideal solar thermoradiative-photovoltaic systems\noutperform solar thermophotovoltaic converters for low bandgaps and practical\nabsorber temperatures. Their performance enhancement results from a high\ntolerance to nonradiative generation/recombination and an ability to minimize\nradiative heat losses. We show that a realistic device with all major losses\ncould achieve increases in solar conversion efficiency by up to 7.9% (absolute)\ncompared to a solar thermophotovoltaic device under low optical concentration.\nOur results indicate that these converters could serve as efficient heat\nengines for low cost single axis tracking systems.",

    "abstract": "Halide perovskites have outstanding photovoltaic properties which have been\noptimized through interfacial engineering. However, as these materials approach\nthe limits imposed by the physics of semiconductor junctions, it is urgent to\nexplore alternatives, such as the bulk photovoltaic effect, whose physical\norigin is different and not bound by the same limits. In this context, we focus\non the flexo-photovoltaic effect, a type of bulk photovoltaic effect that was\nrecently observed in oxides under strain gradients. We have measured the\nflexo-photovoltaic effect of MAPbBr3 and MAPbI3 crystals under bending and\nfound it to be orders of magnitude larger than for SrTiO3, the benchmark\nflexo-photovoltaic oxide. For sufficiently large strain gradients,\nphotovoltages bigger than the bandgap can be produced. Bulk photovoltaic\neffects are additive and, for MAPbI3, the flexo-photovoltage exists on top of a\nnative bulk photovoltage that is hysteretic, consistent with the electrically\nswitchable macroscopic polarization of this material. The results suggest that\nharnessing the flexo-photovoltaic effect through strain gradient engineering\ncan provide a functional leap forward for halide perovskites.",

    "abstract": "Spintronics, which aims at exploiting the spin degree of freedom of carriers\ninside electronic devices, has a huge potential for quantum computation and\ndissipationless interconnects. Ideally, spin currents in spintronic devices\nshould be powered by a spin voltage generator able to drive spins out of\nequilibrium and produce two spatially well-separated populations with opposite\nspin orientation. Such a generator should work at room temperature, be highly\nintegrable with existing semiconductor technology, and work with neither\nferromagnetic materials nor externally applied magnetic fields. We have matched\nthese requirements by realizing the spintronic equivalent of a photovoltaic\ncell. While the latter spatially separates photoexcited electron and hole\ncharges, our device exploits circularly polarized light to produce two\nspatially well-defined electron populations with opposite spin. This is\nachieved by modulating the phase and amplitude of the light wavefronts entering\na semiconductor (germanium) with a patterned metal overlayer (platinum). This\nallows creating a light diffraction pattern with spatially-modulated chirality\ninside the semiconductor, which locally excites spin-polarized electrons thanks\nto electric dipole selection rules.",

This asymmetry remains unclear and is often attributed to\nextrinsic effects. We show here for the first time that such an asymmetry can\nbe intrinsic, steaming from the superposition of asymmetries of internal FE\nbias and electro-piezo-strictive deformation. This hypothesis is confirmed by\nthe observed decrease of PV asymmetry for smaller FE bias. Moreover, the both\nPV effect and remanent polarization are found to increase under vacuum-induced\nexpansion and to decrease for gas-induced compression, with tens percents\ntunability. The change in cations positions under pressure is analysed through\nthe first-principle density functional theory calculations.

The limitations of current designs are: wind instability, high cost\nof installations, and small power output of a single unit. The wind energy\nindustry needs of revolutionary ideas to increase the capabilities of wind\ninstallations. This article suggests a revolutionary innovation which produces\na dramatic increase in power per unit and is independent of prevailing weather\nand at a lower cost per unit of energy extracted. The main innovation consists\nof large free-flying air rotors positioned at high altitude for power and air\nstream stability, and an energy cable transmission system between the air rotor\nand a ground based electric generator. The air rotor system flies at high\naltitude up to 14 km. A stability and control is provided and systems enable\nthe changing of altitude.\n  This article includes six examples having a high unit power output (up to 100\nMW). The proposed examples provide the following main advantages: 1. Large\npower production capacity per unit - up to 5,000-10,000 times more than\nconventional ground-based rotor designs; 2. The rotor operates at high altitude\nof 1-14 km, where the wind flow is strong and steady; 3. Installation cost per\nunit energy is low. 4.

    "abstract": "Recently, there has been a push by countries to diversify their energy mix\nconsidering various factors. In this regard, there have been several studies\nconducted to assess the potential for using sources such as wind and solar to\ngenerate supplemental energy to the already present energy generation setup. In\nthis regard, this study explores the potential of wind for the Commonwealth of\nKentucky. To perform this study, wind data was sourced for eight locations\nacross Kentucky from the publicly accessible wind speed information present at\nWeatherunderground for the years 2020-2021. An analysis was performed\nconcerning the seasonal, monthly and hourly variation in the wind speed so as\nto identify the expected times of sufficient wind energy generation. Moreover,\na comparison of the collected data was performed with data from a home-based\nweather station and a deployed wind turbine as well to validate the variation\npattern of the publicly sourced data. Finally, in order to investigate the\nvariation patterns of wind and solar energy sources, a comparative analysis was\nalso performed using data from a solar power generation plant in Kentucky. It\nwas observed that a seasonal and monthly complemetarity was observed between\nthe wind and solar. However, when considering daily patterns, the wind was\nfound to follow solar generation with an offset. While further research is\nrequired, this analysis indicates that it is possible to deploy wind energy\npower generation projects in the Commonwealth of Kentucky. The seasonal\ncomplementary behavior of wind and solar can be used along with battery storage\nin conjunction with natural gas to provide a diversified electricity generation\nportfolio.",

    "abstract": "A fundamental concern in progressing Airborne Wind Energy (AWE) operations\ntowards commercial success, is guaranteeing that safety requirements placed on\nthe systems are met. Due to the high dimensional complexity of AWE systems,\nhowever, formal mathematical robustness guarantees become difficult to compute.\nWe draw on research from Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis to compute\nthe optimal control policy for tracking a flight path, while enforcing safety\nconstraints on the system. In addition, the zero-sublevel set of the computed\nvalue function inherent in HJ reachability analysis indicates the backward\nreachable set, the set of states from which it is possible to safely drive the\nsystem into a target set within a given time without entering undesirable\nstates. Furthermore, we derive a switching law, such that the safety controller\ncan be used in conjunction with arbitrary least restrictive controllers to\nprovide a safe hybrid control law. In such a setup, the safety controller is\nonly activated when the system approaches the boundary of its maneuverability\nenvelope. Such a hybrid control law is a notable improvement over existing\nrobust control approaches that deteriorate performance by assuming the\nworst-case environmental and system behavior at all times. We illustrate our\nresults via extensive simulation-based studies.",

    "title": "An optimal reeling control strategy for pumping airborne wind energy systems without wind speed feedback",
    "abstract": "Pumping airborne wind energy (AWE) systems employ a kite to convert wind\nenergy into electricity, through a cyclic reeling motion of the tether. The\nproblem of computing the optimal reeling speed for the sake of maximizing the\naverage cycle power is considered. The difficulty stems from two aspects: 1)\nthe uncertain, time- (and space-) varying nature of wind speed, which can not\nbe measured accurately, and 2) the need to consider, in the same optimization\nproblem, the different operational phases of the power cycle. A new,\nmodel-based approach that solves this problem is proposed. In the design phase,\na model of the AWE system is employed to collect data pertaining to the cycle\npower obtained with various reel-in/reel-out speed pairs, assuming known wind\nspeed. Then, a nonlinear map, identified from these data, is used as cost\nfunction in an optimization program that computes the best reel-in and -out\nspeed pairs for each wind speed. Finally, the optimization results are\nexploited to infer the link between optimal reeling speed and tether force,\nwhich are both measured with high accuracy. Such a link is used to design a\nfeedback controller that computes the reeling speed based on the measured\ntether force, in order to converge on the optimal force-speed manifold.\nSimulation results with a realistic model illustrate the effectiveness of the\napproach.",

    "abstract": "Real-time altitude control of airborne wind energy (AWE) systems can improve\nperformance by allowing turbines to track favorable wind speeds across a range\nof operating altitudes. The current work explores the performance implications\nof deploying an AWE system with sensor configurations that provide different\namounts of data to characterize wind speed profiles. We examine various control\nobjectives that balance trade-offs between exploration and exploitation, and\nuse a persistence model to generate a probabilistic wind speed forecast to\ninform control decisions. We assess system performance by comparing power\nproduction against baselines such as omniscient control and stationary flight.\nWe show that with few sensors, control strategies that reward exploration are\nfavored. We also show that with comprehensive sensing, the implications of\nchoosing a sub-optimal control strategy decrease. This work informs and\nmotivates the need for future research exploring online learning algorithms to\ncharacterize vertical wind speed profiles.",

    "title": "On the Kite-Platform Interactions in Offshore Airborne Wind Energy Systems: Frequency Analysis and Control Approach",
    "abstract": "This study investigates deep offshore, pumping Airborne Wind Energy systems,\nfocusing on the kite-platform interaction. The considered system includes a 360\nm2 soft-wing kite, connected by a tether to a winch installed on a\n10-meter-deep spar with four mooring lines. Wind power is converted into\nelectricity with a feedback controlled periodic trajectory of the kite and\ncorresponding reeling motion of the tether. An analysis of the mutual influence\nbetween the platform and the kite dynamics, with different wave regimes,\nreveals a rather small sensitivity of the flight pattern to the platform\noscillations; on the other hand, the frequency of tether force oscillations can\nbe close to the platform resonance peaks, resulting in possible increased\nfatigue loads and damage of the floating and submerged components. A control\ndesign procedure is then proposed to avoid this problem, acting on the kite\npath planner. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the approach.",

The proposed\nmethod enables efficient data collection from multiple wind installations using\nUAV optical sensors, considering the spatial positioning of blades and other\ncomponents of the wind energy installation. It includes component segmentation\nof the wind energy unit (WEU), determination of the blade pitch angle, and\ngeneration of optimal flight trajectories, considering safe distances and\noptimal viewing angles. The results of computational experiments have\ndemonstrated the advantage of the proposed method in monitoring WEU, achieving\na 78% reduction in inspection time, a 17% decrease in total trajectory length,\nand a 6% increase in average blade surface coverage compared to traditional\nmethods. Furthermore, the process minimizes the average deviation from the\noptimal trajectory by 68%, indicating its high accuracy and ability to\ncompensate for external influences.",

    "title": "Getting more with less? Why repowering onshore wind farms does not always lead to more wind power generation -- a German case study",
    "abstract": "The best wind locations are nowadays often occupied by old, less efficient\nand relatively small wind turbines. Many of them will soon reach the end of\ntheir operating lifetime, or lose financial support. Therefore, repowering\ncomes to the fore. However, social acceptance and land use restrictions have\nbeen under constant change since the initial expansions, which makes less area\navailable for new turbines, even on existing sites. For the example of Germany,\nthis study assesses the repowering potential for onshore wind energy in high\ndetail, on the basis of regionally differentiated land eligibility criteria.\nThe results show that under the given regional criteria, repowering will\ndecrease both operating capacity and annual energy yield by roughly 40\\,\\%\ncompared to the status quo. This is because around half of the wind turbines\nare currently located in restricted areas, given newly enacted exclusion\ncriteria. Sensitivity analyses on the exclusion criteria show that the minimum\ndistance to discontinuous urban fabric is the most sensitive criterion in\ndetermining the number of turbines that can be repowered. As regulations on\nthis can vary substantially across different regions, the location-specific\nmethodology chosen here can assess the repowering potential more realistically\nthan existing approaches.",

    "title": "The Near-Optimal Feasible Space of a Renewable Power System Model",
    "abstract": "Models for long-term investment planning of the power system typically return\na single optimal solution per set of cost assumptions. However, typically there\nare many near-optimal alternatives that stand out due to other attractive\nproperties like social acceptance. Understanding features that persist across\nmany cost-efficient alternatives enhances policy advice and acknowledges\nstructural model uncertainties. We apply the modeling-to-generate-alternatives\n(MGA) methodology to systematically explore the near-optimal feasible space of\na completely renewable European electricity system model. While accounting for\ncomplex spatio-temporal patterns, we allow simultaneous capacity expansion of\ngeneration, storage and transmission infrastructure subject to linearized\nmulti-period optimal power flow. Many similarly costly, but technologically\ndiverse solutions exist. Already a cost deviation of 0.5% offers a large range\nof possible investments. However, either offshore or onshore wind energy along\nwith some hydrogen storage and transmission network reinforcement are essential\nto keep costs within 10% of the optimum.",

    "abstract": "To meet its commitments under the Paris Agreement and reduce its dependency\non energy imports, the pace, and scale of renewable energy deployment across\nEurope must increase dramatically over the next decade. Such a steep change in\nthe net-zero transition will inevitably necessitate trade-offs with other\nsocietal priorities. Here we investigate a case study focused on the opposition\ntowards onshore wind and the compromises that may need to be made to deliver\nits plans for deep electrification. Using an electricity system model, we\nexplore the implications of key social and environmental dimensions shaping the\nfuture deployment of onshore wind on the costs and design of electricity\nsystems for Norway in 2030. We find that under restrictions that allow for\nalmost no additional onshore wind, demand can not be met and load has to be\nshed. Yet, when reducing the restrictions on onshore wind or allowing for\nin-country transmission expansion, feasible system designs at a small fraction\nof that cost can be found. To meet the net-zero targets, compromises will need\nto be made on either wind power deployment, transmission expansion,\nnon-electrification of industry or demand reduction.",

    "title": "Offshore Wind Integration in the North Sea: The Benefits of an Offshore Grid and Floating Wind",
    "abstract": "Wind energy has become increasingly important for meeting Europe's energy\nneeds. While onshore wind expansion faces public acceptance problems, for\noffshore wind the European Commission has introduced ambitious goals to\nincrease capacity from 15GW to 300GW in 2050. Incorporating more offshore wind\nelectricity into the power grid may offer a more widely accepted way to satisfy\nEurope's energy demand. In particular, the North Sea region has large potential\nfor offshore wind generation. However, to fully exploit the wind potential in\nthe North Sea, the grid integration of offshore wind and floating wind turbines\nare vital, especially when onshore wind capacity and onshore grid expansion are\nconstrained. For the grid integration, a meshed offshore grid can offer a\nviable alternative to the standard direct connection of offshore wind parks to\nthe nearest point on land combined with point-to-point HVDC connections. In\nthis paper, we investigate the benefits of having a meshed offshore grid in the\nNorth Sea and considering floating wind besides fixed-bottom wind\ninstallations. In our analysis, we look at eight different scenarios, where\nonshore wind potentials and onshore line expansion are limited, to explore the\neffects of low public acceptance. Our results demonstrate that the presence of\nan offshore grid can reduce total system costs by up to 2.6 bn Euro/a. In the\nscenarios with an offshore meshed grid, ~8% more offshore wind capacities are\nbuilt compared to the scenarios without a meshed grid. Furthermore, the\nanalysis shows that if onshore wind potentials are restricted, floating wind\nturbines play a key role and compensate for lacking onshore wind capacities.",

We analyze the frequency\nand duration of such events for onshore wind power in Germany, based on 40\nyears of reanalysis data and open software. We find that low-wind-power events\nare less frequent in winter than in summer, but the maximum duration is\ndistributed more evenly between months. While short events are frequent, very\nlong events are much rarer. Every year, a period of around five consecutive\ndays with an average wind capacity factor below 10% occurs, and every ten years\na respective period of nearly eight days. These durations decrease if only\nwinter months are considered. The longest event in the data lasts nearly ten\ndays. We conclude that public concerns about low-wind-power events in winter\nmay be overrated, but recommend that modeling studies consider multiple weather\nyears to properly account for such events.",

    "abstract": "We suggest a new methodology for designing robust energy systems. For this,\nwe investigate so-called near-optimal solutions to energy system optimisation\nmodels; solutions whose objective values deviate only marginally from the\noptimum. Using a refined method for obtaining explicit geometric descriptions\nof these near-optimal feasible spaces, we find designs that are as robust as\npossible to perturbations. This contributes to the ongoing debate on how to\ndefine and work with robustness in energy systems modelling. We apply our\nmethods in an investigation using multiple decades of weather data. For the\nfirst time, we run a capacity expansion model of the European power system (one\nnode per country) with a 3-hourly temporal resolution with 41 years of weather\ndata. While an optimisation with 41 weather years is at the limits of\ncomputational feasibility, we use the near-optimal feasible spaces of single\nyears to gain an understanding of the design space over the full time period.\nSpecifically, we intersect all near-optimal feasible spaces for the individual\nyears in order to get designs that are likely to be feasible over the entire\ntime period. We find significant potential for investment flexibility, and\nverify the feasibility of these designs by simulating the resulting dispatch\nproblem with four decades of weather data. They are characterised by a shift\ntowards more onshore wind and solar power, while emitting up to 50% less $CO_2$\nthan a cost-optimal solution over that period. Our work builds on recent\ndevelopments in the field, including techniques such as Modelling to Generate\nAlternatives and Modelling All Alternatives, and provides new insights into the\ngeometry of near-optimal feasible spaces and the importance of multi-decade\nweather variability for energy systems design. We also provide an effective way\nof working with a multi-decade time frame in a highly parallelised manner.",

    "abstract": "The resource quality and the temporal generation pattern of variable\nrenewable energy sources vary significantly across Europe. In this paper\nspatial distributions of renewable assets are explored which exploit this\nheterogeneity to lower the total system costs for a high level of renewable\nelectricity in Europe. Several intuitive heuristic algorithms, optimal\nportfolio theory and a local search algorithm are used to find optimal\ndistributions of renewable generation capacities that minimise the total costs\nof backup, transmission and renewable capacity simultaneously. Using current\ncost projections, an optimal heterogeneous distribution favours onshore wind,\nparticularly in countries bordering the North Sea, which results in average\nelectricity costs that are up to 11% lower than for a homogeneous reference\ndistribution of renewables proportional to each country's mean load. The\nreduction becomes even larger, namely 18%, once the transmission capacities are\nput to zero in the homogeneous reference distribution. Heuristic algorithms to\ndistribute renewable capacity based on each country's wind and solar capacity\nfactors are shown to provide a satisfactory approximation to fully optimised\nrenewable distributions, while maintaining the benefits of transparency and\ncomprehensibility. The sensitivities of the results to changing costs of solar\ngeneration and gas supply as well as to the possible cross-sectoral usage of\nunavoidable curtailment energy are also examined.",

The resulting intricate pattern of imports and exports\nrepresents a challenge for the analysis of system costs on the level of\nindividual countries. Using a tracing technique, we introduce flow-based nodal\nlevelized costs of electricity (LCOE) which allow to incorporate capital and\noperational costs associated with the usage of generation capacity located\noutside the respective country under consideration. This concept and a\ncomplementary allocation of transmission infrastructure costs is applied to a\nsimplified model of an interconnected highly renewable European electricity\nsystem.

To date, however, many capacity expansion models lean heavily\ntowards only minimising system cost and only studying a few cost projections.\nHere, we address both criticisms in unison. While taking account of technology\ncost uncertainties, we apply methods from multi-objective optimisation to\nexplore trade-offs in a fully renewable European electricity system between\nincreasing system cost and extremising the use of individual technologies for\ngenerating, storing and transmitting electricity to build robust insights about\nwhat actions are viable within given cost ranges. We identify boundary\nconditions that must be met for cost-efficiency regardless of how cost\ndevelopments will unfold; for instance, that some grid reinforcement and\nlong-term storage alongside a significant amount of wind capacity appear\nessential. But, foremost, we reveal that near the cost-optimum a broad spectrum\nof regionally and technologically diverse options exists in any case, which\nallows policymakers to navigate around public acceptance issues.

In this study, we utilize an open-source energy system optimization\nmodel and publicly available datasets to examine future electricity generation,\nCO2 emissions, and CO2 abatement costs for the North Carolina electric power\nsector through 2050. Model scenarios include uncertainty in future fuel prices,\na hypothetical CO2 cap, and an extended renewable portfolio standard. Across\nthe modeled scenarios, solar photovoltaics represent the most cost-effective\nlow-carbon technology, while trade-offs among carbon constrained scenarios\nlargely involve natural gas and renewables. We also develop a new method to\ncalculate break-even costs, which indicate the capital costs at which different\ntechnologies become cost-effective within the model. Significant variation in\nbreak-even costs are observed across different technologies and scenarios. We\nillustrate how break-even costs can be used to inform the development of an\nextended renewable portfolio standard in North Carolina. Utilizing the\nbreak-even costs to calibrate a tax credit for onshore wind, we find that the\nresultant wind deployment displaces other renewables, and thus has a negligible\neffect on CO2 emissions.

    "abstract": "Energy system modellers typically choose a low spatial resolution for their\nmodels based on administrative boundaries such as countries, which eases data\ncollection and reduces computation times. However, a low spatial resolution can\nlead to sub-optimal investment decisions for wind and solar generation.\nIgnoring power grid bottlenecks within regions tends to underestimate system\ncosts, while combining locations with different wind and solar capacity factors\nin the same resource class tends to overestimate costs. We investigate these\ntwo competing effects in a capacity expansion model for Europe's power system\nwith a high share of renewables, taking advantage of newly-available\nhigh-resolution datasets as well as computational advances. We vary the number\nof nodes, interpolating between a 37-node model based on country and\nsynchronous zone boundaries, and a 1024-node model based on the location of\nelectricity substations. If we focus on the effect of renewable resource\nresolution and ignore network restrictions, we find that a higher resolution\nallows the optimal solution to concentrate wind and solar capacity at sites\nwith better capacity factors and thus reduces system costs by up to 10%\ncompared to a low resolution model. This results in a big swing from offshore\nto onshore wind investment. However, if we introduce grid bottlenecks by\nraising the network resolution, costs increase by up to 23% as generation has\nto be sourced more locally at sites with worse capacity factors. These effects\nare most pronounced in scenarios where grid expansion is limited, for example,\nby low local acceptance. We show that allowing grid expansion mitigates some of\nthe effects of the low grid resolution, and lowers overall costs by around 16%.",

    "title": "STOCHOS: Stochastic Opportunistic Maintenance Scheduling For Offshore Wind Farms",
    "abstract": "Despite the promising outlook, the numerous economic and environmental\nbenefits of offshore wind energy are still compromised by its high operations\nand maintenance (O&M) expenditures. On one hand, offshore-specific challenges\nsuch as site remoteness, harsh weather, transportation requirements, and\nproduction losses, significantly inflate the O&M costs relative to land-based\nwind farms. On the other hand, the uncertainties in weather conditions, asset\ndegradation, and electricity prices largely constrain the farm operator's\nability to identify the time windows at which maintenance is possible, let\nalone optimal. In response, we propose STOCHOS, short for the stochastic\nholistic opportunistic scheduler--a maintenance scheduling approach tailored to\naddress the unique challenges and uncertainties in offshore wind farms. Given\nprobabilistic forecasts of key environmental and operational parameters,\nSTOCHOS optimally schedules the offshore maintenance tasks by harnessing the\nopportunities that arise due to favorable weather conditions, on-site\nmaintenance resources, and maximal operating revenues. STOCHOS is formulated as\na two-stage stochastic mixed integer linear program, which we solve using a\nscenario-based rolling horizon algorithm that aligns with the industrial\npractice. Tested on real-world data from the U.S. North Atlantic where several\noffshore wind farms are in-development, STOCHOS demonstrates considerable\nimprovements relative to prevalent maintenance benchmarks, across various O&M\nmetrics, including total cost, downtime, resource utilization, and maintenance\ninterruptions.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, with the development of wind energy, the number and scale of\nwind farms are developing rapidly. Since offshore wind farm has the advantages\nof stable wind speed, clean, renewable, non-polluting and no occupation of\ncultivated land, which has gradually become a new trend of wind power industry\nall over the world. The operation and maintenance mode of offshore wind power\nis developing in the direction of digitization and intelligence. It is of great\nsignificance to carry out the research on the monitoring, operation and\nmaintenance of offshore wind farm, which will be of benefits to reduce the\noperation and maintenance cost, improve the power generation efficiency,\nimprove the stability of offshore wind farm system and build smart offshore\nwind farm. This paper will mainly analyze and summarize the monitoring,\noperation and maintenance of offshore wind farm, especially from the following\npoints: monitoring of \"offshore wind power engineering & biological &\nenvironment\", the monitoring of power equipment and the operation & maintenance\nof smart offshore wind farms. Finally, the future research challenges about\nmonitoring, operation and maintenance of smart offshore wind farm are proposed,\nand the future research directions in this field are prospected.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents developed real-time simulation models for offshore wind\nturbine generators in compliance with industry standards. The critical control\nfunctions such as negative sequence injection, sequence current limit, voltage\nride through, and power curtailments are designed to meet the industry\nrequirements for future electromagnetic transient (EMT) testing and controls of\noffshore wind farms. Average-value and switching detailed models are developed\nin the Opal-RT real-time simulator. Real-time capabilities of these models are\ncompared to show the effectiveness of the average-value model in terms of\naccuracy and computation efficiency. Studies of balanced and unbalanced faults\nillustrate the ability of the proposed turbine models to inject active and\nreactive currents during fault events. The models are validated against the\nsecond-generation generic wind turbine model proposed by Western Electricity\nCoordinating Council (WECC). Validation results reveal that the proposed models\nare aligned with the WECC generic model. In addition, the models provide an\nextended capability in mitigating the active power oscillation during\nunbalanced fault conditions.",

    "title": "Methodologies for offshore wind power plants stability analysis",
    "abstract": "The development of larger Offshore Wind Power Plants (OWPPs) is moving\ntowards multi-vendor setups, ultimately aiming to establish Energy hubs. These\nstructures are characterized by installations from different vendors sharing\nthe same connection or closely interconnected points. Control interactions\namong Wind Turbine (WT) converters and power systems have been detected, and\nthis critical phenomenon can significantly impact the dynamic stability of the\nsystem. Various stability analysis methods have been proposed to analyze the\ninteractions between OWPPs at the Point-of-Connection (PoC) and the power\nsystem. However, stability studies rarely consider the complex offshore\ntransmission system behind the PoC. Generally, the overall OWPP is blamed for\nthe instability. However, since it is a complex system, it is important to\nunderstand which part of the OWPP behind the PoC is causing the problem or is\nlikely to become unstable under certain conditions. Therefore, this paper\nprovides a detailed overview of the advantages and limitations of the current\nsystem screening indexes used to design the OWPP, and the stability analysis\nmethods. Each method is discussed, and the appropriate methods, depending on\nOWPP structure, are evaluated and discussed. The analysis indicates that a\ncombination of time domain and frequency domain methods is necessary for\nenhancing the definition of stability boundaries.",

    "title": "Global Optimization of Offshore Wind Farm Collection Systems",
    "abstract": "A mathematical program for global optimization of the cable layout of\nOffshore Wind Farms (OWFs) is presented. The model consists on a Mixed Integer\nLinear Program (MILP). Modern branch-and-cut solvers are able to solve\nlarge-scale instances, defined by more than hundred Wind Turbines (WTs), and a\nreasonable number of Offshore Substations (OSSs). In addition to the MILP model\nto optimize total cable length or initial investment, a pre-processing strategy\nis proposed in order to incorporate total electrical power losses into the\nobjective function. High fidelity models are adapted to calculate cables\ncurrent capacities, spatial currents. The MILP model is embedded in an\niterative algorithmic framework, consisting in solving a sequence of problems\nwith increasing size of the search space. The search space is defined as a set\nof underlying candidate arcs. The applicability of the method is illustrated\nthrough 10 case studies of real-world large-scale wind farms. Results show\nthat: (i) feasible points can quickly be obtained in seconds, (ii) points near\nthe global optimum with an imposed maximum tolerance, are calculable in\nreasonable computational time in the order of hours, and (iii) the proposed\nmethod compares favorably against a state-of-the art method available in\nliterature.",

    "title": "Multi-Objective Transmission Expansion: An Offshore Wind Power Integration Case Study",
    "abstract": "Despite ambitious offshore wind targets in the U.S. and globally, offshore\ngrid planning guidance remains notably scarce, contrasting with\nwell-established frameworks for onshore grids. This gap, alongside the\nincreasing penetration of offshore wind and other clean-energy resources in\nonshore grids, highlights the urgent need for a coordinated planning framework.\nOur paper describes a multi-objective, multistage generation, storage and\ntransmission expansion planning model to facilitate efficient and resilient\nlarge-scale adoption of offshore wind power. Recognizing regulatory emphasis\nand, in some cases, requirements to consider externalities, this model\nexplicitly accounts for negative externalities: greenhouse gas emissions and\nlocal emission-induced air pollution. Utilizing an 8-zone ISO-NE test system\nand a 9-zone PJM test system, we explore grid expansion sensitivities such as\nimpacts of optimizing Points of Interconnection (POIs) versus fixed POIs,\nnegative externalities, and consideration of extreme operational scenarios\nresulting from offshore wind integration. Our results indicate that accounting\nfor negative externalities necessitates greater upfront investment in clean\ngeneration and storage (balanced by lower expected operational costs).\nOptimizing POIs could significantly reshape offshore topology or POIs, and\nlower total cost. Finally, accounting for extreme operational scenarios\ntypically results in greater operational costs and sometimes may alter onshore\nline investment.",

    "title": "Cost-benefit Analysis And Comparisons For Different Offshore Wind Energy Transmission Systems",
    "abstract": "This paper investigates how to efficiently and economically deliver offshore\nenergy generated by offshore wind turbines to onshore. Both power cables and\nhydrogen energy facilities are analyzed. Each method is examined with the\nassociated proposed optimal sizing model. A cost-benefit analysis is conducted,\nand these methods are compared under different scenarios. Three long-distance\nenergy transmission methods are proposed to transmit offshore energy onshore,\nconsidering the capital/operation costs for related energy conversion and\ntransmission facilities. The first method that deploys power cables only is a\nbenchmark method. The other two methods utilize a hydrogen supercenter (HSC)\nand transmit offshore energy to and onshore substation through hydrogen\npipelines. For the second method, electrolyzers are placed at offshore wind\nfarms connected to HSC with low-pressure hydrogen pipelines. For the third\nmethod, offshore wind power is distributed to the HSC and then converted into\nhydrogen using electrolyzers placed at the HSC. An offshore scenario including\nthree wind farms located in the Gulf of Mexico and one onshore substation is\nused as the base test case. Numerical simulations are conducted over a planning\nperiod of 30 years using the proposed optimization models for each method\nseparately. Simulation results show that the proposed hydrogen-based methods\ncan effectively transmit offshore energy to the onshore substation. The\ndistances between the wind farms can influence the selection and configuration\nof the offshore wind energy system. Moreover, the proposed study analyzes the\ncost and benefits for various systems with different energy carriers. It can\nalso suggest which method could be the best candidate for offshore energy\ndelivery system under which scenario and demonstrate a promising future for\noffshore wind power generation.",

    "title": "Offshore Wind Turbine Tower Design and Optimization: A Review and AI-Driven Future Directions",
    "abstract": "Offshore wind energy leverages the high intensity and consistency of oceanic\nwinds, playing a key role in the transition to renewable energy. As energy\ndemands grow, larger turbines are required to optimize power generation and\nreduce the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCoE), which represents the average cost\nof electricity over a project's lifetime. However, upscaling turbines\nintroduces engineering challenges, particularly in the design of supporting\nstructures, especially towers. These towers must support increased loads while\nmaintaining structural integrity, cost-efficiency, and transportability, making\nthem essential to offshore wind projects' success. This paper presents a\ncomprehensive review of the latest advancements, challenges, and future\ndirections driven by Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the design optimization of\nOffshore Wind Turbine (OWT) structures, with a focus on towers. It provides an\nin-depth background on key areas such as design types, load types, analysis\nmethods, design processes, monitoring systems, Digital Twin (DT), software,\nstandards, reference turbines, economic factors, and optimization techniques.\nAdditionally, it includes a state-of-the-art review of optimization studies\nrelated to tower design optimization, presenting a detailed examination of\nturbine, software, loads, optimization method, design variables and\nconstraints, analysis, and findings, motivating future research to refine\ndesign approaches for effective turbine upscaling and improved efficiency.\nLastly, the paper explores future directions where AI can revolutionize tower\ndesign optimization, enabling the development of efficient, scalable, and\nsustainable structures. By addressing the upscaling challenges and supporting\nthe growth of renewable energy, this work contributes to shaping the future of\noffshore wind turbine towers and others supporting structures.",

    "title": "Assessing the Impact of Offshore Wind Siting Strategies on the Design of the European Power System",
    "abstract": "This paper provides a detailed account of the impact of different offshore\nwind siting strategies on the design of the European power system. To this end,\na two-stage method is proposed. In the first stage, a highly-granular siting\nproblem identifies a suitable set of sites where offshore wind plants could be\ndeployed according to a pre-specified criterion. Two siting schemes are\nanalysed and compared within a realistic case study. These schemes essentially\nselect a pre-specified number of sites so as to maximise their aggregate power\noutput and their spatiotemporal complementarity, respectively. In addition, two\nvariants of these siting schemes are provided, wherein the number of sites to\nbe selected is specified on a country-by-country basis rather than Europe-wide.\nIn the second stage, the subset of previously identified sites is passed to a\ncapacity expansion planning (CEP) framework that sizes the power generation,\ntransmission and storage assets that should be deployed and operated in order\nto satisfy pre-specified electricity demand levels at minimum cost. Results\nshow that the complementarity-based siting criterion leads to system designs\nwhich are up to 5% cheaper than the ones relying the power output-based\ncriterion when offshore wind plants are deployed with no consideration for\ncountry-based deployment targets. On the contrary, the power output-based\nscheme leads to system designs which are consistently 2% cheaper than the ones\nleveraging the complementarity-based siting strategy when such constraints are\nenforced. The robustness of the results is supported by a sensitivity analysis\non offshore wind capital expenditure and inter-annual weather variability,\nrespectively.",

    "title": "A Review: Challenges and Opportunities for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics in the Offshore Wind Sector",
    "abstract": "A global trend in increasing wind turbine size and distances from shore is\nemerging within the rapidly growing offshore wind farm market. In the UK, the\noffshore wind sector produced its highest amount of electricity in the UK in\n2019, a 19.6% increase on the year before. Currently, the UK is set to increase\nproduction further, targeting a 74.7% increase of installed turbine capacity as\nreflected in recent Crown Estate leasing rounds. With such tremendous growth,\nthe sector is now looking to Robotics and Artificial Intelligence (RAI) in\norder to tackle lifecycle service barriers as to support sustainable and\nprofitable offshore wind energy production. Today, RAI applications are\npredominately being used to support short term objectives in operation and\nmaintenance. However, moving forward, RAI has the potential to play a critical\nrole throughout the full lifecycle of offshore wind infrastructure, from\nsurveying, planning, design, logistics, operational support, training and\ndecommissioning. This paper presents one of the first systematic reviews of RAI\nfor the offshore renewable energy sector. The state-of-the-art in RAI is\nanalyzed with respect to offshore energy requirements, from both industry and\nacademia, in terms of current and future requirements. Our review also includes\na detailed evaluation of investment, regulation and skills development required\nto support the adoption of RAI. The key trends identified through a detailed\nanalysis of patent and academic publication databases provide insights to\nbarriers such as certification of autonomous platforms for safety compliance\nand reliability, the need for digital architectures for scalability in\nautonomous fleets, adaptive mission planning for resilient resident operations\nand optimization of human machine interaction for trusted partnerships between\npeople and autonomous assistants.",

    "abstract": "Offshore wind farms have emerged as a popular renewable energy source that\ncan generate substantial electric power with a low environmental impact.\nHowever, integrating these farms into the grid poses significant complexities.\nTo address these issues, optimal-sized energy storage can provide potential\nsolutions and help improve the reliability, efficiency, and flexibility of the\ngrid. Nevertheless, limited studies have attempted to perform energy storage\nsizing while including design and operations (i.e., control co-design) for\noffshore wind farms. As a result, the present work develops a control co-design\noptimization formulation to optimize multiple objectives and identify Pareto\noptimal solutions. The graph-based optimization framework is proposed to\naddress the complexity of the system, allowing the optimization problem to be\ndecomposed for large power systems. The IEEE-9 bus system is treated as an\nonshore AC grid with two offshore wind farms connected via a multi-terminal DC\ngrid for our use case. The developed methodology successfully identifies the\nPareto front during the control co-design optimization, enabling\ndecision-makers to select the best compromise solution for multiple objectives.",

    "abstract": "Offshore wind power in the North Sea is considered a main pillar in Europe's\nfuture energy system. A key challenge lies in determining the optimal spatial\ncapacity allocation of offshore wind parks in combination with the dimensioning\nand layout of the connecting high-voltage direct current grid infrastructure.\nTo determine economically cost optimal configurations, we apply an integrated\ncapacity and transmission expansion problem within a pan-European electricity\nmarket and transmission grid model with a high spatial and temporal\ngranularity. By conducting scenario analysis for the year 2030 with a gradually\nincreasing CO2 price, possible offshore expansion paths are derived and\npresented. Special emphasis is laid on the effects of weather uncertainty by\nincorporating data from 21 historical weather years in the analysis. Two key\nfindings are (i) an expansion in addition to the existing offshore wind\ncapacity of 0 GW (136 EUR/tCO2), 12 GW (159 EUR/tCO2) and 30 GW (186 EUR/tCO2)\ndependent on the underlying CO2 price.

    "abstract": "The origin of earthquake has long been recognized as resulting from\nstrike-slip instability of plate tectonics along the fault lines. Several\nevents of earthquake around the globe have happened which cannot be explained\nby this theory. In this work we investigated the earthquake data along with\nother observed facts like heat flow profiles etc... of the Indian subcontinent.\nIn our studies we found a high-quality correlation between the earthquake\nevents, seismic prone zones, heat flow regions and the geothermal hot springs.\nAs a consequence, we proposed a hypothesis which can adequately explain all the\nearthquake events around the globe as well as the overall geo-dynamics. It is\nbasically the geothermal power, which makes the plates to stand still, strike\nand slip over. The plates are merely a working solid while the driving force is\nthe geothermal energy. The violent flow and enormous pressure of this power\nshake the earth along the plate boundaries and also triggers the intra-plate\nseismicity. In the light of the results reported by the California Energy\nCommission from the ongoing geothermal power project at the Big Geysers in\nCalifornia, we further propounded that by harnessing the surplus geothermal\nenergy the intensity and risk of the impending earthquakes can be substantially\nreduced.",

Thus, new material solutions beyond conventional silicon CMOS\ndevices are necessary for high temperature, resilient electronic systems.\nAccomplishing this will require a united effort to explore development,\nintegration, and ultimately manufacturing of non-silicon-based logic and memory\ntechnologies, non-traditional metals for interconnects, and ceramic packaging\ntechnology.",

    "title": "Quantification of Bore Path Uncertainty in Borehole Heat Exchanger Arrays",
    "abstract": "Borehole heat exchanger arrays have become a common implement for the\nutilization of thermal energy in the soil. Building these facilities is\nexpensive, especially the drilling of boreholes, into which closed-pipe heat\nexchangers are inserted. Therefore, cost-reducing drilling methods are common\npractice, which can produce inaccuracies of varying degree. This brings into\nquestion how much these inaccuracies could potentially affect the performance\nof a planned system. In the presented case study, an uncertainty quantification\nfor seasonally operated borehole heat exchanger arrays is performed to analyze\nthe bore paths' deviations impact. We introduce an adaptive, anisotropic\nstochastic collocation method, known as the generalized Smolyak algorithm,\nwhich was previously unused in this context and apply it to a numerical model\nof the borehole heat exchanger array. Our results show that the borehole heat\nexchanger array performance is surprisingly reliable even with potentially\nsevere implementation errors during their construction. This, coupled with the\npotential uses of the presented method in similar applications gives planners\nand investors valuable information regarding the viability of borehole heat\nexchanger arrays in the face of uncertainty. With this paper, we hope to\nprovide a powerful statistical tool to the field of geothermal energy, in which\nuncertainty quantification methods are still rarely used at this point. The\ndiscussed case study represents a jumping-off point for further investigations\non the effects of uncertainty on borehole heat exchanger arrays and borehole\nthermal energy storage systems.",

    "title": "Control-oriented modeling of a LiBr/H2O absorption heat pumping device and experimental validation",
    "abstract": "Absorption heat pumping devices (AHPDs, comprising absorption heat pumps and\nchillers) are devices that use thermal energy instead of electricity to\ngenerate heating and cooling, thereby facilitating the use of waste heat and\nrenewable energy sources such as solar or geothermal energy. Despite this\nbenefit, widespread use of AHPDs is still limited. One reason for this is\npartly unsatisfactory control performance under varying operating conditions,\nwhich can result in poor modulation and part load capability. A promising\napproach to tackle this issue is using dynamic, model-based control strategies,\nwhose effectiveness, however, strongly depend on the model being used. This\npaper therefore focuses on the derivation of a viable dynamic model to be used\nfor such model-based control strategies for AHPDs such as state feedback or\nmodel-predictive control. The derived model is experimentally validated,\nshowing good modeling accuracy. Its modeling accuracy is also compared to\nalternative model versions, that contain other heat transfer correlations, as a\nbenchmark. Although the derived model is mathematically simple, it does have\nthe structure of a nonlinear differential-algebraic system of equations. To\nobtain an even simpler model structure, linearization at an operating point is\ndiscussed to derive a model in linear state space representation. The\nexperimental validation shows that the linear model does have slightly worse\nsteady-state accuracy, but that the dynamic accuracy seems to be almost\nunaffected by the linearization. The presented new modeling approach is\nconsidered suitable to be used as a basis for the design of advanced,\nmodel-based control strategies, ultimately aiming to improve the modulation and\npart load capability of AHPDs.",

    "abstract": "Deep Geothermal Energy, Carbon Capture, and Storage and Hydrogen Storage have\nsignificant potential to meet the large-scale needs of the energy sector and\nreduce the CO$_2$ emissions. However, the injection of fluids into the earth's\ncrust, upon which these activities rely, can lead to the formation of new\nseismogenic faults or the reactivation of existing ones, thereby causing\nearthquakes. In this study, we propose a novel approach based on control theory\nto address this issue. First, we obtain a simplified model of induced\nseismicity due to fluid injections in an underground reservoir using a\ndiffusion equation in three dimensions. Then, we design a robust tracking\ncontrol approach to force the seismicity rate to follow desired references. In\nthis way, the induced seismicity is minimized while ensuring fluid circulation\nfor the needs of renewable energy production and storage. The designed control\nguarantees the achievement of the control objectives even in the presence of\nsystem uncertainties and unknown dynamics. Finally, we present simulations of a\nsimplified geothermal reservoir under different scenarios of energy demand to\nshow the reliability and performance of the control approach, opening new\nperspectives for field experiments based on real-time regulators.",

    "title": "Absorption of Carbon Dioxide in Kerogen Nanopores: A Mechanism Study using the Molecular Dynamics Monte Carlo Method",
    "abstract": "Carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology has been applied successfully in\nrecent decades to reduce carbon emissions and alleviate global warming. In this\nregard, shale reservoirs present tremendous potential for carbon dioxide (CO2)\nsequestration as they have a large number of nanopores. Molecular dynamics (MD)\nand MD-Monte Carlo (MDMC) methods were employed in this work to study the\nabsorption behavior of CO2 in shale organic porous media. The MDMC method is\nused to analyze the spatial states of CO2, and the results are in good\nagreement with MD results, and it also performs well in the acceleration\ncompared to the classical MD. With regard to the kerogen matrix, its\nproperties, such as the pore size distribution (PSD), pore volume, and surface\narea, are determined to describe its different compression states and the\neffects of CO2 absorption on it. The potential energy distribution and\npotential of mean force are analyzed to verify the spatial distribution of CO2\nmolecules. The heterogeneity of the pore structure resulted in heterogeneous\ndistributions of CO2 molecules in kerogen porous media. Moreover, strong\ncompression of the matrix reduces the number of large pores, and the PSD is\nmainly between 0 and 15 Angstrom. Despite the high interaction force of the\nkerogen matrix, the high-potential-energy region induced by the kerogen\nskeleton also contributes to the formation of low-energy regions that encourage\nthe entry of CO2. An increase in temperature facilitates the absorption\nprocess, allowing CO2 molecules to enter the isolated pores with stronger\nthermal motion, thereby increasing the storage capacity for CO2. However, the\ndevelopment of geothermal energy may not be suitable for CO2 sequestration.",

Predicting the\nfracture orientation while also possessing a non-linear material response\nbecomes more complex when the medium is non-homogeneous and anisotropic.\nFracturing behaviour in geological porous media that exhibit high leak-off\npotential is not clearly understood. In this context, a novel testing technique\nis used to simulate the ground conditions in the laboratory and study the\ninstability characteristics of such geo-materials.

    "title": "Physically Guided Deep Unsupervised Inversion for 1D Magnetotelluric Models",
    "abstract": "The global demand for unconventional energy sources such as geothermal energy\nand white hydrogen requires new exploration techniques for precise subsurface\nstructure characterization and potential reservoir identification. The\nMagnetotelluric (MT) method is crucial for these tasks, providing critical\ninformation on the distribution of subsurface electrical resistivity at depths\nranging from hundreds to thousands of meters. However, traditional iterative\nalgorithm-based inversion methods require the adjustment of multiple\nparameters, demanding time-consuming and exhaustive tuning processes to achieve\nproper cost function minimization. Recent advances have incorporated deep\nlearning algorithms for MT inversion, primarily based on supervised learning,\nand large labeled datasets are needed for training. This work utilizes\nTensorFlow operations to create a differentiable forward MT operator,\nleveraging its automatic differentiation capability. Moreover, instead of\nsolving for the subsurface model directly, as classical algorithms perform,\nthis paper presents a new deep unsupervised inversion algorithm guided by\nphysics to estimate 1D MT models. Instead of using datasets with the observed\ndata and their respective model as labels during training, our method employs a\ndifferentiable modeling operator that physically guides the cost function\nminimization, making the proposed method solely dependent on observed data.\nTherefore, the optimization algorithm updates the network weights to minimize\nthe data misfit. We test the proposed method with field and synthetic data at\ndifferent acquisition frequencies, demonstrating that the resistivity models\nobtained are more accurate than those calculated using other techniques.",

    "title": "Thermal Fracturing of Geothermal Wells and the Effects of Borehole Orientation",
    "abstract": "An enhanced geothermal system (EGS) expands the potential of geothermal\nenergy by enabling the exploitation of regions that lack conventional\nhydrothermal resources. The EGS subsurface system is created by engineering\nenhanced flow paths between injection and production wells. Hydraulic\nstimulation of existing fracture networks has been successfully achieved for\nunconventional geothermal resources. More recently proposed concepts increase\nthe use of drilled wellbores in hard rock to connect the injection and\nproduction wells. The present work investigates the long-term thermal effects\nof deviated geothermal wellbores and studies how the cooling of the borehole\nwall results in thermally induced tensile fractures. The results show that\ninduced fractures are created by a combination of in situ and thermal stresses,\nand that the extent to which thermally induced tensile wall fractures are\ncreated largely depends on how the wellbores are oriented with respect to the\npre-existing stresses of the reservoir. If the system is not optimized with\nrespect to in situ stresses, the risk of wellbore instability becomes severe\nwithin less than a year of production. In contrast, if the orientation of the\nwellbores is optimized, thermally induced instabilities can be completely\nexcluded as potential risks for the operational lifetime of the system.\nFurthermore, our results show that the thermal failure process strongly depends\non the temperature of the injected water but is only weakly affected by the\ninjection rate.",

    "abstract": "There is a pressing need for a transition from fossil fuel to renewable\nenergy to meet the increasing energy demands and reduce greenhouse gas (GHG)\nemissions. The Himalayas possess substantial renewable energy potential that\ncan be harnessed through hydropower projects due to its peculiar topographic\ncharacteristics and abundant water resources. However, the current exploitation\nrate is low owing to the predominance of run-of-river hydropower systems to\nsupport the power system. The utility-scale storage facility is crucial in the\nload scenario of an integrated power system to manage diurnal variation, peak\ndemand, and penetration of intermittent energy sources. In this study, we first\nidentify the potential of pumped storage hydropower across Nepal (a central\nHimalayan country) under multiple configurations by pairing lakes, hydropower\nprojects, rivers, and available flat terrains. We then identify technically\nfeasible pairs from those of potential locations. Infrastructural,\nenvironmental, operational, and other technical constraints govern the choice\nof feasible locations. We find the flat land-to-river configuration most\npromising than other configurations. Our results provide insight into the\npotential of pumped storage hydropower and are of practical importance in\nplanning sustainable power systems in the Himalayas and beyond.",

    "abstract": "Previous research has raised concerns about energy droughts in\nrenewables-based energy systems. This study explores the ability of reservoir\nhydropower to sustain a high output and, thereby, mitigate such energy\ndroughts. Using detailed modelling, we estimate that Swedish hydropower can\nsustain 67-92% of its installed capacity for 3 weeks, with higher values\npossible in springtime. The variation of the sustained output, equivalent to\nthe capacity of 3-4 Swedish nuclear reactors, under-scores the importance of\nunderstanding the potential output levels when devising strategies to\ncounteract energy droughts. Moreover, we find that regulations imposed on the\nflows in river bottlenecks hinder higher sustained output levels. With the\nupcoming renewal of environmental permits for hydropower plants in Sweden,\nthese findings provide valuable insights for policymakers. Furthermore, the\nsustained output capabilities demonstrated in this study challenge the\nprevalent simplified representations of hydropower in energy models, suggesting\na need for more-sophisticated modelling approaches.",

    "abstract": "In the evolving power system, where new renewable resources continually\ndisplace conventional generation, conventional hydropower resources can be an\nimportant asset that helps to maintain reliability and flexibility. Varying\nclimatic patterns do affect the operational pattern of hydropower. This would\npotentially play a vital role in meeting and delivering energy and meeting\nclimate policy needs. Hydropower is one of the oldest forms of renewable energy\nresources, however, its dependency on water availability and other constraints\nare not well represented in power system steady state and dynamic models. This\nleads to multiple gaps in operations planning especially due to high\nintermittent renewable generation. Operating constraints and lack of\nhigh-quality data often become a barrier to hydropower modeling which leads to\ninconsistencies in reliability and operational planning studies resulting in\nunintentional blackouts or unforeseen situations. This paper identifies some of\nthe gaps in hydro-based generation representation in steady-state and dynamic\nmodels and provides recommendations for their mitigation.",

    "abstract": "This paper discusses linearized models of hydropower plants (HPPs). First, it\nreviews state-of-the-art models and discusses their non-linearities, then it\nproposes suitable linearization strategies for the plant head, discharge, and\nturbine torque. It is shown that neglecting the dependency of the hydroacoustic\nresistance on the discharge leads to a linear formulation of the hydraulic\ncircuits model. For the turbine, a numerical linearization based on a\nfirst-order Taylor expansion is proposed. Model performance is evaluated for a\nmedium- and a low-head HPP with a Francis and Kaplan turbine, respectively.\nPerspective applications of these linear models are in the context of efficient\nmodel predictive control of HPPs based on convex optimization.",

The main purpose of this work is because to\nmaintain frequency in small-hydropower plant at nominal value. So, proposed\ncontroller means Fuzzy PD optimization with Genetic Algorithm will be used for\nLFC in small scale of hydropower system. The proposed schema can be used in\ndifferent designation of both diesel generator and mini-hydropower system at\nlow stream flow. It is also possible to use diesel generator at the hydropower\nsystem which can be turn off when Consumer demand is higher than electricity\ngeneration. The simulation will be done in MATLAB/Simulink to represent and\nevaluate the performance of this control schema under dynamic frequency\nvariations. Spiking Neural Network (SNN) used as the main deep learning\ntechniques to optimizing this load frequency control which turns into Deep\nSpiking Neural Network (DSNN).

    "abstract": "This paper presents a solution to address wear and tear of Run-of-River (RoR)\nHydropower Plants (HPPs) providing enhanced Frequency Containment Reserve\n(FCR). In this respect, the study proposes the integration of a Battery Energy\nStorage System (BESS) with RoR HPPs controlled by a double-layer Model\nPredictive Control (MPC). The upper layer MPC acts as a state of energy manager\nfor the BESS, employing a forecast of the required regulating energy for the\nnext hour. The lower-layer MPC optimally allocates the power set-point between\nthe turbine and the BESS. Reduced-scale experiments are performed on a\none-of-a-kind testing platform to validate the proposed MPC- based control\nconsidering a comparison with different control strategies and different BESS\nsizes. The results demonstrate superior performance of the proposed framework,\ncompared to simpler techniques like dead-band control or to the standalone RoR\nscenario, leading to improved FCR provision, reduced servomechanism stress, and\nextended hydropower asset lifespan.",

    "abstract": "A hybrid hydropower power plant is a conventional HydroPower Plant (HPP)\naugmented with a Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) to decrease the wear and\ntear of sensitive mechanical components and improve the reliability and\nregulation performance of the overall plant. A central task of controlling\nhybrid power plants is determining how the total power set-point should be\nsplit between the BESS and the hybridized unit (power set-point splitting) as a\nfunction of the operational objectives. This paper describes a Model Predictive\nControl (MPC) framework for hybrid medium- and high-head plants to determine\nthe power set-point of the hydropower unit and the BESS. The splitting policy\nrelies on an explicit formulation of the mechanical loads incurred by the HPP's\npenstock, which can be damaged due to fatigue when providing regulation\nservices to the grid. By filtering out from the HPP's power set-point the\ncomponents conducive to excess penstock fatigue and properly controlling the\nBESS, the proposed MPC is able to maintain the same level of regulation\nperformance while significantly decreasing damages to the hydraulic conduits. A\nproof-of-concept by simulations is provided considering a 230 MW medium-head\nhydropower plant.",

    "title": "A Carryover Storage Valuation Framework for Medium-Term Cascaded Hydropower Planning: A Portland General Electric System Study",
    "abstract": "Medium-term planning of cascaded hydropower (CHP) determines appropriate\ncarryover storage levels in reservoirs to optimize the usage of available water\nresources. This optimization seeks to maximize the hydropower generated in the\ncurrent period (i.e., immediate benefit) plus the potential hydropower\ngeneration in the future period (i.e., future value). Thus, in the medium-term\nCHP planning, properly quantifying the future value deposited in carryover\nstorage is essential to achieve a balanced trade-off between immediate benefit\nand future value. To this end, this paper presents a framework to quantify the\nfuture value of carryover storage, which consists of three major steps: i)\nconstructing a model to calculate the maximum possible hydropower generation\nthat a given level of carryover storage can deliver in the future period; ii)\nextracting the implicit locational marginal water value (LMWV) of carryover\nstorage for each reservoir by applying a partition-then-extract algorithm to\nthe constructed model; and iii) developing a set of analytical rules based on\nthe extracted LMWV to effectively calculate the future value. These rules can\nbe seamlessly integrated into medium-term CHP planning models as tractable\nmixed-integer linear constraints to quantify the future value properly, and can\nbe easily visualized to offer valuable insights for CHP operators. Finally,\nnumerical results on a CHP system of Portland General Electric demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the presented framework in determining proper carryover\nstorage values to facilitate medium-term CHP planning.",

    "abstract": "Quantifying uncertainties in estimating future hydropower production directly\nor indirectly affects India's energy security, planning, and management. The\nchaotic and nonlinear nature of atmospheric processes results in considerable\nInternal Climate Variability (ICV) for future projections of climate variables.\nMultiple Initial Condition Ensembles (MICE) and Multi-Model Ensembles (MME) are\noften used to analyze the role of ICV and model uncertainty in precipitation\nand temperature. However, there are limited studies focusing on quantifying the\nrole of internal variability on impact variables, including hydropower\nproduction. In this study, we analyze the role of ICV and model uncertainty on\nthree prominent hydropower plants of India using MICE of EC-Earth3 and MME from\nCMIP6. We estimate the streamflow projections for all ensembles using the\nVariable Infiltration Capacity hydrological model for four time periods,\nhistorical, near, mid and far-term. We estimate maximum hydropower production\ngenerated using monthly release and hydraulic head available at the reservoir.\nWe also analyzed the role of bias correction in hydropower production. The\nresults show that ICV plays a significant role in estimating streamflow and\nhydropower estimation for monsoon and throughout the year, respectively. Model\nuncertainty contributes more to total uncertainty than ICV in estimating the\nstreamflow and potential hydropower. However, ICV is increasing towards the\nfar-term. We also show that bias correction does not preserve the internal\nvariability in estimating the streamflow. Although there is an increase in\nuncertainty for estimated streamflow, mean hydropower shows the decrease\ntowards the far-term for February to May, more prominent for MICE than MME. The\nresults suggest a need to incorporate uncertainty due to internal variability\nfor addressing power security in changing climate scenarios.",

    "abstract": "To enable power supply in rural areas and to exploit clean energy, fully\nrenewable power systems consisting of cascaded run-of-the-river hydropower and\nvolatile energies such as pv and wind are built around the world. In islanded\noperation mode, the primary and secondary frequency control, i.e., hydro\ngovernors and automatic generation control (AGC), are responsible for the\nfrequency stability. However, due to limited water storage capacity of\nrun-of-the-river hydropower and river dynamics constraints, without\ncoordination between the cascaded plants, the traditional AGC with fixed\nparticipation factors cannot fully exploit the adjustability of cascaded\nhydropower. When imbalances between the volatile energy and load occur, load\nshedding can be inevitable. To address this issue, this paper proposes a\ncoordinated tertiary control approach by jointly considering power system\ndynamics and the river dynamics that couples the cascaded hydropower plants.\nThe timescales of the power system and river dynamics are very different. To\nunify the multi-timescale dynamics to establish a model predictive controller\nthat coordinates the cascaded plants, the relation between AGC parameters and\nturbine discharge over a time interval is approximated by a data-based\nsecond-order polynomial surrogate model. The cascaded plants are coordinated by\noptimising AGC participation factors in a receding-horizon manner, and load\nshedding is minimised. Simulation of a real-life system with real-time pv data\ncollected on site shows the proposed method significantly reduces load loss\nunder pv volatility.",

    "abstract": "Due to the scarcity of fault samples and the complexity of non-linear and\nnon-smooth characteristics data in hydroelectric units, most of the traditional\nhydroelectric unit fault localization methods are difficult to carry out\naccurate localization. To address these problems, a sparse autoencoder\n(SAE)-generative adversarial network (GAN)-wavelet noise reduction (WNR)-\nmanifold-boosted deep learning (SG-WMBDL) based fault localization method for\nhydroelectric units is proposed. To overcome the data scarcity, a SAE is\nembedded into the GAN to generate more high-quality samples in the data\ngeneration module. Considering the signals involving non-linear and non-smooth\ncharacteristics, the improved WNR which combining both soft and hard\nthresholding and local linear embedding (LLE) are utilized to the data\npreprocessing module in order to reduce the noise and effectively capture the\nlocal features. In addition, to seek higher performance, the novel Adaptive\nBoost (AdaBoost) combined with multi deep learning is proposed to achieve\naccurate fault localization. The experimental results show that the SG-WMBDL\ncan locate faults for hydroelectric units under a small number of fault samples\nwith non-linear and non-smooth characteristics on higher precision and accuracy\ncompared to other frontier methods, which verifies the effectiveness and\npracticality of the proposed method.",

    "abstract": "Hydraulic energy is a key component of the global energy mix, yet there\nexists no practical way of harvesting it at small scales, from flows at low\nReynolds number. This has triggered the search for alternative hydroelectric\nconversion methodologies, leading to unconventional proposals based on droplet\ntriboelectricity, water evaporation, osmotic energy or flow-induced ionic\nCoulomb drag. Yet, these approaches systematically rely on ions as intermediate\ncharge carriers, limiting the achievable power density. Here, we predict that\nthe kinetic energy of small-scale \"waste\" flows can be directly and efficiently\nconverted into electricity thanks to the hydro-electronic drag effect, by which\nan ion-free liquid induces an electronic current in the solid wall along which\nit flows. This effect originates in the fluctuation-induced coupling between\nfluid motion and electron transport. We develop a non-equilibrium thermodynamic\nformalism to assess the efficiency of such hydroelectric energy conversion,\ndubbed hydronic energy. We find that hydronic energy conversion is analogous to\nthermoelectricity, with the efficiency being controlled by a dimensionless\nfigure of merit. However, in contrast to its thermoelectric analogue, this\nfigure of merit combines independently tunable parameters of the solid and the\nliquid, and can thus significantly exceed unity. Our findings suggest new\nstrategies for blue energy harvesting without electrochemistry, and for waste\nflow mitigation in membrane-based filtration processes.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we describe a novel turbine failsafe system designed for a\npico-hydroelectric power generation. We designed and built a pico-hydroelectric\nsystem in a remote rural Himalayan village. We developed a Prioritized Load\nControl System (PLCS) that diverts excess electrical power to useful purposes\nsuch as heating up bath water and the air in the community center when the\nelectrical demand from the village is low; instead of dumping the excess\nelectricity back into the river in the form of heat. A critical part of the\nPLCS system is the failsafe mechanism where the turbines and electrical\ncomponents on the grid are protected in case any part of the PLCS system stops\nfunctioning, possibly intermittently. Our novel failsafe system contains the\nfollowing enhancements compared to previous systems: (1) adjustable threshold\nvoltage, (2) controllable fractional power diversion with adjustable\nparameters, (3) automatic reset with adjustable parameters. In addition, the\nfailsafe subsystem uses the widely available Arduino platform and programming\nenvironment, and JSON for human readable and writable communications,\ndemonstrating their suitability for critical applications.",

    "abstract": "The constant increase in the amount and complexity of information obtained\nfrom IT data networkelements, for its correct monitoring and management, is a\nreality. The same happens to data net-works in electrical systems that provide\neffective supervision and control of substations and hydro-electric plants.\nContributing to this fact is the growing number of installations and new\nenvironmentsmonitored by such data networks and the constant evolution of the\ntechnologies involved. This sit-uation potentially leads to incomplete and/or\ncontradictory data, issues that must be addressed inorder to maintain a good\nlevel of monitoring and, consequently, management of these systems. Inthis\npaper, a prototype of an expert system is developed to monitor the status of\nequipment of datanetworks in electrical systems, which deals with\ninconsistencies without trivialising the inferences.This is accomplished in the\ncontext of the remote control of hydroelectric plants and substationsby a\nRegional Operation Centre (ROC). The expert system is developed with algorithms\ndefinedupon a combination of Fuzzy logic and Paraconsistent Annotated Logic\nwith Annotation of TwoValues (PAL2v) in order to analyse uncertain signals and\ngenerate the operating conditions (faulty,normal, unstable or inconsistent /\nindeterminate) of the equipment that are identified as importantfor the remote\ncontrol of hydroelectric plants and substations. A prototype of this expert\nsystemwas installed on a virtualised server with CLP500 software (from the\nEFACEC manufacturer) thatwas applied to investigate scenarios consisting of a\nRegional (Brazilian) Operation Centre, with aGeneric Substation and a Generic\nHydroelectric Plant, representing a remote control environment.",

The specificity\nof the grid has led HQ to develop monitoring tools responsible for generating\nso-called stability limits. Those stability limits take into account several\nnonlinear phenomena such as angular stability, frequency stability, or voltage\nstability. Since generation planning and operation tools rely mostly on mixed\ninteger linear programming formulation, HQ had to adapt its tools to integrate\nstability limits into them. This paper presents the challenges it faced,\nespecially considering its reserve monitoring tool and unit commitment tool.",

    "abstract": "The growing penetration of renewable energy sources (RESs) is inevitable to\nreach net zero emissions. In this regard, optimal planning and operation of\npower systems are becoming more critical due to the need for modeling the\nshort-term variability of RES output power and load demand. Considering hourly\ntime steps of one or more years to model the operational details in a long-term\nexpansion planning scheme can lead to a practically unsolvable model.\nTherefore, a clustering-based hybrid time series aggregation algorithm is\nproposed in this paper to capture both extreme values and temporal dynamics of\ninput data by some extracted representatives. The proposed method is examined\nin a complex co-planning model for transmission lines, wind power plants\n(WPPs), short-term battery and long-term pumped hydroelectric energy storage\nsystems. The effectiveness of proposed mixed-integer linear programming (MILP)\nmodel is evaluated using a modified 6-bus Garver test system. The simulation\nresults confirm the proposed model efficacy, especially in modeling long-term\nenergy storage systems.",

    "abstract": "This study presents an innovative tool designed to unlock the potential of\nMichigan's lakes and dams for applications such as water resource management\nand renewable energy generation. Given Michigan's relatively flat landscape,\nthe focus is on systems that could serve as micro-hydro energy storage\nsolutions. To ensure accuracy and reliability, the tool incorporates extensive\ndata gathered from authorized sources, covering more than 420 water facilities\nand potential reservoirs in the state. These data are used as part of a case\nstudy to evaluate the tool's capabilities. Key parameters assessed include\nhorizontal and vertical distances (head), volume, and the total storage\ncapacity of each reservoir, measured in GWh. By analyzing these factors, the\ntool determines the suitability of various lakes and dams for hydroelectric\npower generation, and other uses based on the horizontal and vertical threshold\ndistances. Its robust assessment framework integrates these metrics to\ncomprehensively evaluate each site's potential.

    "abstract": "Accurate energy demand forecasting is crucial for sustainable and resilient\nenergy development. To meet the Net Zero Representative Concentration Pathways\n(RCP) $4.5$ scenario in the DACH countries, increased renewable energy\nproduction, energy storage, and reduced commercial building consumption are\nneeded. This scenario's success depends on hydroelectric capacity and climatic\nfactors. Informed decisions require quantifying uncertainty in forecasts. This\nstudy explores a non-parametric method based on \\emph{reproducing kernel\nHilbert spaces (RKHS)}, known as kernel quantile regression, for energy\nprediction. Our experiments demonstrate its reliability and sharpness, and we\nbenchmark it against state-of-the-art methods in load and price forecasting for\nthe DACH region. We offer our implementation in conjunction with additional\nscripts to ensure the reproducibility of our research.",

    "title": "Modeling the impact of extreme summer drought on conventional and renewable generation capacity: methods and a case study on the Eastern U.S. power system",
    "abstract": "The United States has witnessed a growing prevalence of droughts in recent\nyears, posing significant challenges to water supplies and power generation.\nThe resulting impacts on power systems, including reduced capacity and the\npotential for power outages, underscore the need for accurate assessment\nmethods to ensure the reliable operation of the nation's energy infrastructure.\nA critical step is to evaluate the usable capacity of a regional power system's\ngeneration fleet, which is a complex undertaking and requires precise modeling\nof the effects of hydrological and meteorological conditions on diverse\ngenerating technologies. This paper proposes a systematic, analytical approach\nfor assessing the impacts of extreme summer drought events on the available\ncapacity of hydro, thermal, and renewable energy generators. More specifically,\nthe systematic framework provides plant-level capacity derating models for\nhydroelectric, once-through cooling thermoelectric, recirculating cooling\nthermoelectric, combustion turbine, solar PV, and wind turbine systems.\nApplication of the proposed impact assessment framework to the 2025 generation\nfleet of the real-world power system in the PJM and SERC regions yields\ninsightful results. By examining the daily usable capacity of 6,055 at-risk\ngenerators throughout the study region, we find that in the event of the\nrecurrence of the 2007 southeastern summer drought in the near future, the\nusable capacity of all at-risk power plants may experience a substantial\ndecrease compared to a typical summer, falling within the range of 71% to 81%.\nThe sensitivity analysis reveals that the usable capacity would experience a\nmore pronounced decline under more severe drought conditions. The findings of\nthis study offer valuable insights, enabling stakeholders to enhance the\nresilience of power systems against the potential effects of extreme drought in\nthe future.",

    "abstract": "Hydroelectricity, being a renewable source of energy, globally fulfills the\nelectricity demand. Hence, Hydropower Plants (HPPs) have always been in the\nlimelight of research. The fast-paced technological advancement is enabling us\nto develop state-of-the-art power generation machines. This has not only\nresulted in improved turbine efficiency but has also increased the complexity\nof these systems. In lieu thereof, efficient Operation & Maintenance (O&M) of\nsuch intricate power generation systems has become a more challenging task.\nTherefore, there has been a shift from conventional reactive approaches to more\nintelligent predictive approaches in maintaining the HPPs. The research is\ntherefore targeted to develop an artificially intelligent fault prognostics\nsystem for the turbine bearings of an HPP. The proposed method utilizes the\nLong Short-Term Memory (LSTM) algorithm in developing the model. Initially, the\nmodel is trained and tested with bearing vibration data from a test rig.\nSubsequently, it is further trained and tested with realistic bearing vibration\ndata obtained from an HPP operating in Pakistan via the Supervisory Control and\nData Acquisition (SCADA) system. The model demonstrates highly effective\npredictions of bearing vibration values, achieving a remarkably low RMSE.",

    "title": "Assessing the Optimistic Bias in the Natural Inflow Forecasts: A Call for Model Monitoring in Brazil",
    "abstract": "Hydroelectricity accounted for roughly 66% of the total generation in Brazil\nin 2023 and addressed most of the intermittency of wind and solar generation.\nThus, one of the most important steps in the operation planning of this country\nis the forecast of the natural inflow energy (NIE) time series, an\napproximation of the energetic value of the water inflows. To manage water\nresources over time, the Brazilian system operator performs long-term forecasts\nfor the NIE to assess the water values through long-term hydrothermal planning\nmodels, which are then used to define the short-term merit order in day-ahead\nscheduling. Therefore, monitoring optimistic bias in NIE forecasts is crucial\nto prevent an optimistic view of future system conditions and subsequent\nriskier storage policies. In this article, we investigate and showcase strong\nevidence of an optimistic bias in the official NIE forecasts, with predicted\nvalues consistently exceeding the observations over the past 12 years in the\ntwo main subsystems (Southeast and Northeast). Rolling window out-of-sample\ntests conducted with real data demonstrate that the official forecast model\nexhibits a statistically significant bias of 6%, 13%, 18%, and 23% for 1, 6,\n12, and 24 steps ahead in the Southeast subsystem, and 19%, 57%, 80%, and 108%\nin the Northeast.",

    "abstract": "The logistic function is used to forecast energy consumed worldwide and oil\nproduction in the U.S. The logistic substitution model is used to describe the\nenergy mix since 1965 presenting a picture significantly different from the one\ncovering the previous 100 years. In the new picture coal gently gains on oil\nand hydroelectric gains on natural gas even if it is three times smaller.\nFinally, renewables (wind, geothermal, solar, biomass, and waste) grow\nexclusively on the expense of nuclear and are poised to overtake it by the late\n2030s. By mid-21st century, coal, oil, and natural gas still remain the main\nplayers of comparable size. Hydroelectric has almost doubled in size. The only\nsignificant substitution is that of renewables having replaced nuclear albeit\nremaining at less than one-fourth the size of the other three energy sources.\nU.S. oil produced by fracking is forecasted to cease by mid-21st century, while\noil produced by traditional methods should continue on its slowly declining\ntrend. US oil production is likely to represent less than 1% of the oil\nconsumed worldwide by mid-21st century.",

    "title": "Challenges and Opportunities for Bioenergy in Europe: National Deployment, Policy Support, and Possible Future Roles",
    "abstract": "Bioenergy is currently a major renewable energy source in Europe but faces an\nunclear future because of conflicting modelling results and the lack of\nlong-term policy. This paper identifies three challenges and potential\nopportunities by reviewing bioenergy historical national deployment, current\npolicy support, and possible future roles in Europe. The first challenge is on\nthe supply side. Analysing the supply-consumption dynamics and import\ndependency of EU bioenergy, we find that the security of bioenergy supply is\nchallenging for liquid biofuels and those countries with the highest per-capita\nbioenergy consumption in Europe. Second, the definition of sustainable\nbioenergy in modelling studies is sometimes inconsistent with how EU policies\nlabel it. Third, on the demand side, there are unique but competing uses for\nbioenergy without a clear long-term strategy in Europe. We conclude with three\nopportunities to tackle these challenges for future research. First, utilising\nthe untapped bioenergy potential with low environmental impacts could improve\nsupply security. A clear and harmonised definition of sustainable bioenergy\ncould better convey modelling results to policymaking. Finally, understanding\nwhere best to use limited sustainable bioenergy supply through sector-coupled\nenergy system models can provide direction for a clearer EU bioenergy strategy\ntowards 2050.",

    "title": "Optimizing Bio-energy Supply Chain to Achieve Alternative Energy Targets",
    "abstract": "In response to global warming and the dwindling reservoirs of fossil fuels,\nThailand has increasingly embraced alternative energy sources. Central to its\nenergy development strategy is the Alternative Energy Development Plan (AEDP),\nwhich aims to reduce energy intensity, capitalize on residual resources, and\nmitigate greenhouse gas emissions. While significant strides have been made in\nmeeting various consumption targets set forth by the AEDP, notable challenges\npersist, particularly in the realms of bio-mass-derived electricity generation,\nbio-gas utilization, and bio-ethanol production from bio-mass. Therefore, this\nstudy delves into the factors contributing to the shortfall in achieving AEDP\ntargets and proposes strategies to enhance the efficiency of the bioenergy\nsupply chain. Leveraging mathematical and linear programming techniques, our\nresearch optimizes the supply chain dynamics, accounting for monthly supplier\nprofiles spanning 77 provinces, 17 distinct biomasses, and 427 bioenergy plants\nequipped with diverse energy conversion technologies. Our findings indicate\nthat Thailand currently boasts adequate bio-mass resources to fulfill the\nelectricity and bio-ethanol targets outlined in the AEDP provided enhancements\nare made to supply chain efficiency. To fully realize the objectives of the\nAEDP, we recommend augmenting bio-mass cultivation efforts and implementing new\npower plant installations. Additionally, we advocate for the consideration of\nhigh-methane content fuels, such as solid waste, as a means to alleviate\nbio-mass demand. This study underscores the paramount importance of strategic\nplanning and optimization in propelling Thailand towards its alternative energy\nambitions while surmounting supply chain impediments.",

    "title": "Accounting for carbon capture solvent cost and energy demand in the energy system",
    "abstract": "Technical carbon dioxide removal through bioenergy with carbon capture or\ndirect air capture plays a role in virtually all climate mitigation scenarios.\nBoth of these technologies rely on the use of chemical solvents or sorbents in\norder to capture CO$_2$. Lately, concerns have surfaced about the cost and\nenergy implications of producing solvents and sorbents at scale. Here, we show\nthat the production of chemical sorbents could have significant implications on\nsystem cost, energy use and material use depending on how much they are\nconsumed. Among the three chemical sorbents investigated, namely\nmonoethanolamine (MEA) for post-combustion carbon capture, potassium hydroxide\nfor liquid direct air capture and polyethylenimine-silica (PEI) for solid\nsorbent direct air capture, we found that the production of the compound for\nsolid sorbent direct air capture represent the highest uncertainties for the\nsystem. At the high range of solid sorbent consumption, total energy system\ncost increased by up to 6.5\\%, while effects for other options were small to\nnegligible. Scale-up of material production capacities was also substantial for\nMEA and PEI. Implications of sorbent consumption for carbon capture\ntechnologies should be considered more thoroughly in scenarios relying on\ndirect air capture using a solid sorbent.",

    "abstract": "Extrusion is a critical process in the manufacturing of various organic\nmaterials, including animal feed, human food, pharmaceuticals, and biomass for\nbioenergy. During extrusion, a dense particle-fluid mixture, or paste, is\npushed through a narrow channel under high pressure. Despite its widespread\nuse, many questions remain about how particle-fluid interactions and frictional\nforces at the wall influence high-pressure paste flow, particularly whether\nlaboratory-scale findings translate to more complex industrial settings. Here,\nwe quantify for the first time how a micrometer thin fluid lubrication layer\nemerges from particle-fluid interactions during the extrusion of organic\nbiomass, controlling friction at the paste-channel interface. This lubrication\nlayer forms through a pressure-induced phase segregation process and is\nsignificantly thinner than the particle size, affecting their contact dynamics,\nmaking friction at the interface tunable. Our results reveal how the thickness\nof the lubrication layer is influenced by paste composition, enhancing our\nfundamental understanding of phase segregation during industrial extrusion\nprocesses and offering potential pathways for reducing energy consumption and\nproduct failure in the industrial material production.",

The statistical steady state reached when the system is in the\nsurvival region of parameter space is characterized by integral constraints and\nupper and lower bounds on the biomass and productivity that follow from\nvariational arguments and direct inequalities. In the limit of\nzero-decorrelation time the velocity field is shown to act as Fickian diffusion\nwith an eddy diffusivity much larger than the molecular diffusivity and this\nallows a one-dimensional model to predict the biomass, productivity and\nextinction transitions.

    "title": "Computational Assessment of Biomass Dust Explosions in the 20L Sphere",
    "abstract": "Determination of the explosion severity parameters of biomass is crucial for\nthe safety management and dust explosion risk assessment of biomass-processing\nindustries. These are commonly determined following experimental tests in the\n20L sphere according to the international standards. Recently, CFD simulations\nhave emerged as a reliable alternative to predict the explosion behavior with\ngood accuracy and reduced labor and capital. In this work, numerical\nsimulations of biomass dust explosions are conducted with the open-source CFD\ncode OpenFOAM. The multi-phase (gas-solid) flow is treated in an\nEulerian-Lagrangian framework, using a two-way coupling regime and considering\nthe reactions of biomass conversion (moisture evaporation, devolatilization,\nand char oxidation), the combustion of volatile gases, and convective and\nradiative heat transfer. The model is validated with pressure-time and\nconcentration-dependent experimental measurements of two biomass samples.\nResults suggest that the characteristics of the cold-flow (\\i.e. turbulence\nlevels, actual dust concentration, spatial distribution of the dust cloud, and\nturbophoresis effect) govern the course of the explosion process, and depend\nstrongly on particle size, dust concentration, and ignition delay time effects.\nThese findings may be relevant in the design of better dust explosion testing\ndevices and to the reexamination of the guidelines for the operation of the\nexperiment. Finally, a thorough discussion on the explosion pressures, degree\nof biomass conversion, flame temperature, flame propagation patterns, and the\ndust agglomeration effect is presented.",

    "title": "GPU-accelerated Logistics Optimisation for Biomass Production with Multiple Simultaneous Harvesters Tours, Fields and Plants",
    "abstract": "Within the context of biomass production, this paper proposes a method for\nlogistics optimisation. Starting from a headquarter multiple tours are to be\nexecuted simultaneously by groups of harvesting units (HUs) and support units\n(SUs) to first harvest biomass from multiple agricultural fields, before\nsupplying the biomass to multiple biogas plants (BPs) via shuttling SUs. This\nproblem is relevant on a larger scale in particular for contractors. This\nproblem is complex since there are three interconnected optimisation levels:\n(i) the assignment of BPs to tours and the ordering of BPs assigned to each\ntour, (ii) the assignment of fields to BPs and the ordering of fields assigned\nto each BP, and (iii) determining the number of HUs and SUs assigned to each\ntour, whereby different HUs and SUs may in general have different working rates\nand loading capacities. Problem modeling and a solution method are discussed.\nFor the latter, a GPU-accelerated heuristic search algorithm is proposed. For\nthe former, an optimisation criterion minimising both total accumulated path\nlength and the maximum completion time over all harvesters tours, an embedded\nlocal minimisation for the assignment of SUs to tours, and demand fulfilment\nconstraints for BPs are discussed. In stochastic simulation experiments it is\nfound that permitting unconstrained assignment of any available field that a\ncontractor services to any available BP, independent of their ownerships, is\ncrucial (i) to attain maximum path length savings, and (ii) also to best\nbalance and minimise uniform completion times over all harvesters tours such\nthat weather-dependent harvesting windows can be exploited optimally.",

The latter antennas\nmight operate at frequencies well above the radar band. The radar signal could\nbe scattered with high RCS from such an antenna, with less influence due to a\nload (receiver). The antenna geometry should be precisely known to derive its\nRCS. BIOMASS SAR operates near 435 MHz (P-band). Results are given, also for\nBIOMASS antenna itself.

    "abstract": "Modeling the burning processes of biomass such as wood, grass, and crops is\ncrucial for the modeling and prediction of wildland and urban fire behavior.\nDespite its importance, the burning of solid fuels remains poorly understood,\nwhich can be partly attributed to the unknown chemical kinetics of most solid\nfuels. Most available kinetic models were built upon expert knowledge, which\nrequires chemical insights and years of experience. This work presents a\nframework for autonomously discovering biomass pyrolysis kinetic models from\nthermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) experimental data using the recently developed\nchemical reaction neural networks (CRNN). The approach incorporated the CRNN\nmodel into the framework of neural ordinary differential equations to predict\nthe residual mass in TGA data. In addition to the flexibility of\nneural-network-based models, the learned CRNN model is interpretable, by\nincorporating the fundamental physics laws, such as the law of mass action and\nArrhenius law, into the neural network structure. The learned CRNN model can\nthen be translated into the classical forms of biomass chemical kinetic models,\nwhich facilitates the extraction of chemical insights and the integration of\nthe kinetic model into large-scale fire simulations. We demonstrated the\neffectiveness of the framework in predicting the pyrolysis and oxidation of\ncellulose. This successful demonstration opens the possibility of rapid and\nautonomous chemical kinetic modeling of solid fuels, such as wildfire fuels and\nindustrial polymers.",

    "abstract": "A generic approach is proposed for the estimation of advanced biocrudes\nproperties from liquefied biomass and the enthalpy of formation of biomass\nfeedstocks applicable to the modeling of biomass conversion processes where the\nexact stoichiometry and kinetics are unknown,such as pyrolysis, solvolysis and\nhydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) . The enthalpy of formation of the biomass is\nestimated through a direct correlation based on ultimate and proximate\nanalysis, whose parameters can easily be fitted with experimental data\navailable from sources such as the Phillys database for different biomass types\nand implemented in process simulators such as Aspen Plus. For the biocrude\nmodeling, a multi-objective optimization model is proposed that refines the\nselection of model compounds to match measured bulk thermochemical and physical\nproperties. Parameter fitting and multi-objective optimization were both\nperformed in Matlab and the codes are available in the supplementary material.\nAs a case study, the optimization model was applied to two different oils\nobtained via HTL and pyrolysis of woody biomass. The first case was further\nstudied in order to estimate the impact of the proposed models in the energy\nrequirements. The process was implemented in Aspen Plus but the methodology is\napplicable to other simulation tools. The results show that the methods for\nestimating enthalpies of formation have a high impact on the energy balance and\nconsequently the models developed allow a more accurate estimation of the\nenergy requirement in the reactor. This is a key element in making accurate\nheat integration and techno-economic analyses of thermochemical conversion\nprocesses.",

    "title": "Combined Hydrothermal Liquefaction of Polyurethane and Lignocellulosic Biomass for improved carbon recovery",
    "abstract": "Due to the high versatility of Polyurethane (PUR), its share amongst\nsynthetic polymers to manufacture consumer goods is increasing. This study\nproposes, tests and validates through pilot processing a highly efficient\nmethod for carbon recovery of PUR and in the form of an oil phase concentrated\nin carbon using hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL). Hot liquid water mixed with\nPUR residues and a lignocellulosic material (two species of Miscanthus) were\ntreated at subcritical water temperatures, generating an oil-phase rich in\nhydrocarbons. A high synergistic effect in the co-liquefaction was observed,\nleading to a carbon and chemical energy recovery to the oil of 71 and 75%\nrespectively. Pilot plant processing, using optimized process parameters,\nyielded a total process efficiency, accounting heating utilities, of 61%,\nresulting in a 3.2 ratio of energy return over investment. Using spectroscopic\nand high-resolution mass spectrometry analysis the oil revealed a high content\nof nitrogen hetero aromatic and polyol compounds. The high synergy observed for\nthe co-liquefaction of PUR and miscanthus is attributed to recombination of\nsynthetic and biological materials, specifically due to aromatics present in\nthe media and nitrogen-containing compounds recombination. The results show\nthat HTL can be an efficient method for carbon recovery of PUR aided by\nbiomass.",

    "title": "Are biofuel mandates cost-effective? -- an analysis of transport fuels and biomass usage to achieve emissions targets in the European energy system",
    "abstract": "Abatement options for the hard-to-electrify parts of the transport sector are\nneeded to achieve ambitious emissions targets. Biofuels based on biomass,\nelectrofuels based on renewable hydrogen and a carbon source, as well as fossil\nfuels compensated by carbon dioxide removal (CDR) are the main options.\nCurrently, biofuels are the only renewable fuels available at scale and are\nstimulated by blending mandates. Here, we estimate the system cost of enforcing\nsuch mandates in addition to an overall emissions cap for all energy sectors.\nWe model overnight scenarios for 2040 and 2060 with the sector-coupled European\nenergy system model PyPSA-Eur-Sec, with a high temporal resolution. The\nfollowing cost drivers are identified: (i) high biomass costs due to scarcity,\n(ii) opportunity costs for competing usages of biomass for industry heat and\ncombined heat and power (CHP) with carbon capture, and (iii) lower scalability\nand generally higher cost for biofuels compared to electrofuels and fossil\nfuels combined with CDR. With a -80% emissions reduction target in 2040,\nvariable renewables, partial electrification of heat, industry and transport\nand biomass use for CHP and industrial heat are important for achieving the\ntarget at minimal cost. Abatement of remaining liquid fossil fuel use increases\nsystem cost, with a 50% biofuel mandate increasing costs by 128-229 billion\nEUR, or 39-82% of the liquid fuel cost. With a negative -105% emissions target\nin 2060, fuel abatement options are necessary, and electrofuels or the use of\nCDR to offset fossil fuel emissions are more competitive than biofuels. Biomass\nis preferred in CHP and industry heat, combined with carbon capture to serve\nnegative emissions or electrofuel production, thereby utilising biogenic carbon\nseveral times. Sensitivity analyses reveal significant uncertainties but\nconsistently support that higher biofuel mandates lead to higher costs.",

    "abstract": "In practical scenarios, addressing real-world challenges often entails the\nincorporation of diverse renewable energy sources, such as solar, energy\nstorage systems, and greenhouse gas emissions. The core purpose of these\ninterconnected systems is to optimize a multitude of factors and objectives\nconcurrently. Hence, it is imperative to formulate models that comprehensively\ncover all these objectives. This paper introduces tri-level mathematical models\nfor Hybrid Renewable Energy Systems (HRESs), offering a framework to\nconcurrently tackle diverse objectives and decision-making levels within the\nrealm of renewable energy integration. The proposed model seeks to maximize the\nefficiency of solar PV, enhance the performance of energy storage systems, and\nminimize greenhouse gas emissions.",

    "abstract": "Grid-connected hybrid renewable power systems with energy storage can reduce\nthe intermittency of renewable power supply. However, emerging energy storage\ntechnologies need improvement to compete with lithium-ion batteries and reduce\nthe cost of energy. Identifying and optimizing the the most valuable\nimprovement path of these technologies is challenging due to the non-linearity\nof the energy system model when considering parameters as independent\nvariables. To overcome this, a novel investment-based optimization method is\nproposed. The method involves linear optimization of the hybrid renewable\nenergy system and subsequent investment optimization, accounting for\ndiminishing improvements per investment. Applied to thermal energy, pumped\nthermal energy, molten salt, and adiabatic compressed air energy storage\ntechnologies, the results show that enhancing discharge efficiency is most\nvaluable for all technologies. Reducing discharge capacity costs and energy\nstorage capacity cost can also become important. Charge capacity cost and\ncharge efficiency are found to be of lesser significance. The study provides\ndetailed improvement pathways for each technology under various operational\nconditions, assisting developers in resource allocation. Overall, the\ninvestment-based optimization method and findings contribute to enhancing the\ncompetitiveness of emerging energy storage technologies and reducing reliance\non batteries in renewable energy systems.",

    "abstract": "The installation of electric vehicle charging stations (EVCS) will be\nessential to promote the acceptance by the users of electric vehicles (EVs).\nHowever, if EVCS are exclusively supplied by the grid, negative impacts on its\nstability together with possible CO2 emission increases could be produced.\nIntroduction of hybrid renewable energy systems (HRES) for EVCS can cope with\nboth drawbacks by reducing the load on the grid and generating clean\nelectricity. This paper develops a methodology based on a weighted\nmulticriteria process to design the most suitable configuration for HRES in\nEVCS. This methodology determines the local renewable resources and the EVCS\nelectricity demand. Then, taking into account environmental, economic and\ntechnical aspects, it deduces the most adequate HRES design for the EVCS.\nBesides, an experimental stage to validate the design deduced from the\nmulticriteria process is included. Therefore, the final design for the HRES in\nEVCS is supported not only by a complete numerical evaluation, but also by an\nexperimental verification of the demand being fully covered. Methodology\napplication to Valencia (Spain) proves that an off-grid HRES with solar PV,\nwind resources and batteries support would be the most suitable configuration\nfor the system.

An open source\nenergy system model is presented here for the analysis of a future Barbadian\nenergy system. The model was applied in a scenario analysis, using a greenfield\napproach, to investigate cost-optimal and 100% renewable energy system\nconfigurations. Within the scenarios, the electrification of private passenger\nvehicles and cruise ships through shore-to-ship power supply was modelled to\nassess its impact on the energy system and the necessary investment in storage.\nResults show that for most scenarios of a system in 2030, a renewable energy\nshare of over 80% is achieved in cost-optimal cases, even with a growing\ndemand. The system's levelised costs of electricity range from 0.17 to 0.36\nBBD/kWh in the cost-optimal scenarios and increase only moderately for 100%\nrenewable systems. Under the reasonable assumption of decreasing photovoltaic\ninvestment costs, system costs of a 100% system may be lower than the current\ncosts.

    "abstract": "The current stage in the evolution of the European internal energy market for\nelectricity is defined by the transformation towards a renewable energy system.\nThe Clean Energy Package aims to ensure that methods for capacity allocation\nand congestion management, that are at the center of the European internal\nmarket for electricity, align with this transformation.\n  Flow-based market coupling, the preferred method for capacity allocation, is\nfirst and foremost a formal process to allocate exchange capacities to the\nmarkets. However, the process also allows for many considerations of the\ninvolved parties that impact the resulting capacities. As part of the Clear\nEnergy Package, the regulatory body enacted their ambition to increase exchange\ncapacities by enforcing transmission system operators to allocate a minimum\nmargin of physical line capacity with the goal of providing a higher level of\ncompetition and better integration of renewable energy sources. This study\ninvestigates this and other policy relevant consideration of flow-based market\ncoupling.\n  The model results quantify the trade-off between permissive capacity\nallocation and increased congestion management. For high shares of intermittent\nrenewable generation, less constrained exchange capacities are favorable,\nhowever also highlight the importance of the markets ability to integrate high\nshares of intermittent generation. apacities are favourable, however also\nhighlight the importance of the markets ability to integrate high shares of\nintermittent generation.",

    "abstract": "Future highly renewable energy systems might require substantial storage\ndeployment. At the current stage, the technology portfolio of dominant storage\noptions is limited to pumped-hydro storage and Li-Ion batteries. It is\nuncertain which storage design will be able to compete with these options.\nConsidering Europe as a case study, we derive the cost and efficiency\nrequirements of a generic storage technology, which we refer to as storage-X,\nto be deployed in the cost-optimal system. This is performed while including\nexisting pumped-hydro facilities and accounting for the competition from\nstationary Li-ion batteries, flexible generation technology, and flexible\ndemand in a highly renewable sector-coupled energy system. Based on a sample\nspace of 724 storage configurations, we show that energy capacity cost and\ndischarge efficiency largely determine the optimal storage deployment, in\nagreement with previous studies. Here, we show that charge capacity cost is\nalso important due to its impact on renewable curtailment. A significant\ndeployment of storage-X in a cost-optimal system requires (a) discharge\nefficiency of at least 95%, (b) discharge efficiency of at least 50% together\nwith low energy capacity cost (10EUR/kWh), or (c) discharge efficiency of at\nleast 25% with very low energy capacity cost (2EUR/kWh). Comparing our findings\nwith seven emerging technologies reveals that none of them fulfill these\nrequirements. Thermal Energy Storage (TES) is, however, on the verge of\nqualifying due to its low energy capacity cost and concurrent low charge\ncapacity cost. Exploring the space of storage designs reveals that system cost\nreduction from storage-X deployment can reach 9% at its best, but this requires\nhigh round-trip efficiency (90%) and low charge capacity cost (35EUR/kW).",

To do so we for the first time explicitly model the network\nstructure and incorporate non-Gaussian, strongly intermittent fluctuations\ntypical for RES.\n  We show that EVs can completely eliminate frequency peaks. Using threshold\nrandomization we further demonstrate that demand synchronization effects and\nbattery stresses can be greatly reduced.

    "abstract": "The state of charge (SoC) and the rate of charging/discharging current are\nthe vital parameters associated with a battery by which its accurate runtime\ncan be estimated. This paper aims to design a controller which comprises of a\nfield-programmable gate array, back to back connected dc-dc converters, and a\nresistive touch display based graphical user interface (GUI). The controller\nestimates SoC and performs constant current charging or discharging of the\nbattery. The implementation of GUI is to input the reference\ncharging/discharging current from the user and to display the SoC. This\nresearch delves into battery and obtains its internal parameters by conducting\nhybrid pulse power characterization test. Furthermore, the obtained internal\nparameters are processed through an extended Kalman filter which yields the\nSoC.

It is often argued that decentralized generation\nalso helps reducing transmission costs, as generation is closer to the load,\nthus utilizing the transmission system less. The research presented here\naddresses the question whether or not, or under what circumstances this effect\nof avoided transmission can actually be seen for a community-operated cluster\nof photovoltaic (PV) power plants in two sample locations, one in Germany and\none in Japan. For the analysis, the newly developed instrument of MPI-MPE\ndiagrams is used, which plot the maximum power import (MPI) and maximum power\nexport (MPE) in relation to the reference case of no local generation. Results\nreveal that for moderately sized PV systems without battery storage, avoided\ntransmission can be seen in the Japanese model location, but not in Germany. It\nwas also found that an additional battery storage can lead to avoided\ntransmission in both locations, even for large sizes of installed PV capacity.",

The prosumers and consumers decide in a probabilistic way when to be\nactive. They keep their information private and do not need to share it with\nother prosumers or consumers in the community. Moreover, we consider a central\nserver that keeps track of the total number of active prosumers and consumers\nand sends feedback signals in the community at each time step; the prosumers\nand consumers use these signals to calculate their probabilistic intent. We\npresent experimental results to check the efficacy of the algorithms.

    "abstract": "The increasing number of Electric Vehicles (EVs) have led to rising energy\ndemands which aggregates the burden on grid supply. A few solutions have been\nproposed to reduce grid load, for example, using storage systems for storing\nsurplus energy from EVs or time-scheduling supply. These solutions are costly\nand limited to specific regions and times. This paper proposes a smart energy\nmanagement solution for a massively electrified road transport network. It\ncomprises of energy supplies from grid, charging stations, renewable sources\nand EVs connected by 5G-enabled aggregators. We propose EVs as prosumers, which\nare energy consumers but also supply back their surplus energy via\nVehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technology. We use machine learning to forecast hourly\nenergy output from renewable sources, surplus supply from EVs and their\ndemands. A grid cost minimization using Mixed Integer Linear Programming\nsolution is proposed to dynamically alter supply according to demand and energy\nprovision from EVs. The upper bounds of surplus supply and demand of EVs are\ntheoretically derived. An incentive distribution mechanism is presented to\nreward EVs offering their surplus supply and to discourage them to become\nselfish which is analyzed using Prisoner's dilemma game. The paper also\npresents an optimum number of charging stations on a road. Simulation results\nshow that the proposed solution can effectively meet the demand requirements\neven if the supply from grid is limited, and can averagely reduce 38.21% of\ngrid load. It results in 5.3% of average cost reduction compared with\noptimization without prosumers. The proposed penalty charge for CO2 emissions\nresults in over 50% cost reduction by using renewable resources in the proposed\nsolution as compared to fossil fuels. The communication and computation\ncomplexity of the proposed solution is reduced by 5G-enabled aggregator.",

    "title": "Modelling the Formation of Peer-to-Peer Trading Coalitions and Prosumer Participation Incentives in Transactive Energy Communities",
    "abstract": "Peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading and energy communities have garnered much\nattention over in recent years due to increasing investments in local energy\ngeneration and storage assets. However, the efficiency to be gained from P2P\ntrading, and the structure of local energy markets raise many important\nchallenges. To analyse the efficiency of P2P energy markets, in this work, we\nconsider two different popular approaches to peer-to-peer trading: centralised\n(through a central market maker/clearing entity) vs. fully decentralised (P2P),\nand explore the comparative economic benefits of these models. We focus on the\nmetric of Gains from Trade (GT), given optimal P2P trading schedule computed by\na schedule optimiser. In both local market models, benefits from trading are\nrealised mainly due to the diversity in consumption behaviour and renewable\nenergy generation between prosumers in an energy community. Both market models\nwill lead to the most promising P2P contracts (the ones with the highest Gains\nfrom Trade) to be established first. Yet, we find diversity decreases quickly\nas more peer-to-peer energy contracts are established and more prosumers join\nthe market, leading to significantly diminishing returns. In this work, we aim\nto quantify this effect using real-world data from two large-scale smart energy\ntrials in the UK, i.e. the Low Carbon London project and the Thames Valley\nVision project. Our experimental study shows that, for both market models, only\na small number of P2P contracts, and only a fraction of total prosumers in the\ncommunity are required to achieve the majority of the maximal potential Gains\nfrom Trade. We also study the effect that diversity in consumption profiles has\non overall trading potential and dynamics in an energy community.",

    "abstract": "Renewable Energy Sources play a key role in smart energy systems. To achieve\n100% renewable energy, utilizing the flexibility potential on the demand side\nbecomes the cost-efficient option to balance the grid. However, it is not\ntrivial to exploit these available capacities and flexibility options\nprofitably. The amount of available flexibility is a complex and time-varying\nfunction of the price signal and weather forecasts. In this work, we use a\nFlexibility Function to represent the relationship between the price signal and\nthe demand and investigate optimization problems for the price signal\ncomputation. Consequently, this study considers the higher and lower levels in\nthe hierarchy from the markets to appliances, households, and districts. This\npaper investigates optimal price generation via the Flexibility Function and\nstudies its employment in controller design for demand-side management, its\ncapability to provide ancillary services for balancing throughout the Smart\nEnergy Operating System, and its effect on the physical level performance.\nSequential and simultaneous approaches for computing the price signal, along\nwith various cost functions are analyzed and compared.

    "abstract": "Ultra-low temperature (ULT) freezers store perishable bio-contents and have\nhigh energy consumption, which highlight a demand for reliable methods for\nintelligent surveillance and smart energy management. This study introduces a\nnovel grey-box modelling approach based on stochastic differential equations to\ndescribe the heat dynamics of the ULT freezing chambers. The proposed modelling\napproach only requires temperature data measured by the embedded sensors and\nuses data from the regular operation periods for model identification. The\nmodel encompasses three states: chamber temperature, envelope temperature, and\nlocal evaporator temperature. Special attention is given to the local\nevaporator temperature state, which is modelled as a time-variant system, to\ncharacterize the time delay and dynamic variations in cooling intensity. Two\nULT freezers with different operational patterns are modelled. The unknown\nmodel parameters are estimated using the maximum likelihood method. The results\ndemonstrate that the models can accurately predict the chamber temperature\nmeasured by the control probe (RMSE < 0.19 {\\deg}C) and are promising to be\napplied for forecasting future states. In addition, the model for local\nevaporator temperature can effectively adapt to different operational patterns\nand provide insight into the local cooling supply status. The proposed approach\ngreatly promotes the practical feasibility of grey-box modelling of the heat\ndynamics for ULT freezers and can serve several potential digital applications.\nA major limitation of the modelling approach is the low identifiability, which\ncan potentially be addressed by inferring model parameters based on relative\nparameter changes.",

These networks are characterized\nby their ability to optimize their operations, aiming to reduce supply\ntemperatures, accommodate distributed heat sources, and leverage the\nflexibility provided by thermal inertia and storage, all crucial for achieving\na fossil-fuel-free energy supply. Developing a smart energy management system\nto accomplish these goals requires detailed models of highly complex nonlinear\nsystems and computational algorithms able to handle large-scale optimization\nproblems. To address this, we introduce a graph-based optimization-oriented\nmodel that efficiently integrates distributed producers, prosumers, storage\nbuffers, and bidirectional pipe flows, such that it can be implemented in a\nreal-time MPC setting. Furthermore, we conduct several numerical experiments to\nevaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms in closed-loop.

Automated verification and policy\nsynthesis for stochastic hybrid systems can be inherently challenging: this is\ndue to the heterogeneity of their dynamics (presence of continuous and discrete\ncomponents), the presence of uncertainty, and in some applications the large\ndimension of state and input sets. Over the past few years, a few hundred\narticles have investigated these models, and developed diverse and powerful\napproaches to mitigate difficulties encountered in the analysis and synthesis\nof such complex stochastic systems. In this survey, we overview the most recent\nresults in the literature and discuss different approaches, including\n(in)finite abstractions, verification and synthesis for temporal logic\nspecifications, stochastic similarity relations, (control) barrier\ncertificates, compositional techniques, and a selection of results on\ncontinuous-time stochastic systems; we finally survey recently developed\nsoftware tools that implement the discussed approaches.

    "abstract": "Smart energy grid is an emerging area for new applications of machine\nlearning in a non-stationary environment. Such a non-stationary environment\nemerges when large-scale failures occur at power distribution networks due to\nexternal disturbances such as hurricanes and severe storms. Power distribution\nnetworks lie at the edge of the grid, and are especially vulnerable to external\ndisruptions. Quantifiable approaches are lacking and needed to learn\nnon-stationary behaviors of large-scale failure and recovery of power\ndistribution. This work studies such non-stationary behaviors in three aspects.\nFirst, a novel formulation is derived for an entire life cycle of large-scale\nfailure and recovery of power distribution. Second, spatial-temporal models of\nfailure and recovery of power distribution are developed as geo-location based\nmultivariate non-stationary GI(t)/G(t)/Infinity queues. Third, the\nnon-stationary spatial-temporal models identify a small number of parameters to\nbe learned. Learning is applied to two real-life examples of large-scale\ndisruptions. One is from Hurricane Ike, where data from an operational network\nis exact on failures and recoveries. The other is from Hurricane Sandy, where\naggregated data is used for inferring failure and recovery processes at one of\nthe impacted areas. Model parameters are learned using real data. Two findings\nemerge as results of learning: (a) Failure rates behave similarly at the two\ndifferent provider networks for two different hurricanes but differently at the\ngeographical regions. (b) Both rapid- and slow-recovery are present for\nHurricane Ike but only slow recovery is shown for a regional distribution\nnetwork from Hurricane Sandy.",

In particular, the\nproposed planner uses virtual placement sets beneath the hip joints of the legs\nand executes a step when the foot is outside of such placement set.\nFurthermore, we propose a parameter design framework that considers both\nenergy-efficiency and robustness measures to optimize the gait by changing the\nshape of the placement set along with other parameters, such as step height and\nswing time, as a function of walking speed. We show that the planner produces\ntrajectories that have a low Cost of Transport (CoT) and high robustness\nmeasure, and evaluate our approach against model-free Reinforcement Learning\n(RL) and motion imitation using biological dog motion priors as the reference.\nOverall, within low to medium velocity range, we show a 50.4% improvement in\nCoT and improved robustness over model-free RL, our best performing baseline.\nFinally, we show ability to handle slippery surfaces, gait transitions, and\ndisturbances in simulation and hardware with the Unitree A1 robot.",

However, the diffusion of EETs in small and\nmedium-sized enterprises is rather slow. Literature shows the interactions\nbetween innovation adopters and potential adopters have significant impacts on\ninnovation diffusion. Enterprises lack the motivation to share information, and\nEETs usually lack observability, which suppress the inter-firm influence.\nTherefore, an information platform, together with proper policies encouraging\nor forcing enterprises to disclose EET-related information, should help harness\ninter-firm influence to accelerate EETs' diffusion. To explore whether and how\nsuch an information platform affects EETs' diffusion in small and medium-sized\nenterprises, this study builds an agent-based model to mimic EET diffusion\nprocesses. Based on a series of controlled numerical experiments, some\ncounter-intuitive phenomena are discovered and explained. The results show that\nthe information platform is a double-edged sword that notably accelerates EETs'\ndiffusion by approximately 47% but may also boost negative information to\ndiffuse even faster and delay massive adoption of EETs. Increasing network\ndensity and the intensity of inter-firm influence are effective to speed EET\ndiffusion, but their impacts diminish drastically after reaching some critical\nvalues (0.05 and 0.15 respectively) and eventually harm the stability of the\nsystem. Hence, the findings implicate that EET suppliers should carefully\nlaunch their promising but immature products; policies that can reduce the\nperceived risk by enterprises and the effort to maintain an informative rather\nthan judgmental information platform can prominently mitigate the negative side\neffects brought by high fluidity of information.",

The unique\nattributes of quantum materials can help address these needs by enabling new\nenergy-efficient device concepts that implement neuromorphic ideas at the\nhardware level.

    "title": "Stochastic Optimal Control of HVAC system for Energy-efficient Buildings",
    "abstract": "The heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) system accounts for\nsubstantial energy use in buildings, whereas a large group of occupants are\nstill not actually feeling comfortable staying inside. This poses the issue of\ndeveloping energy-efficient HVAC control, i.e., reduce energy use (cost) while\nsimultaneously enhancing human comfort. This paper pursues the objective and\nstudies the stochastic optimal HVAC control subject to uncertain thermal demand\n(i.e., the weather and occupancy etc). Particularly, we involve the elaborate\npredicted mean vote (PMV) thermal comfort model in the optimization. The\nproblem is computationally challenging due to the non-linear and non-analytical\nconstraints imposed by the system dynamics and PMV model. We make the following\ncontributions to address it. First, we formulate the problem as a Markov\ndecision process (MDP) which is a desirable modeling technique capable of\nhandling the complexities. Second, we propose a gradient-based learning (GB-L)\nmethod for progressively learning a stochastic control policy off-line and\nstore it for on-line execution. Third, we prove the learning method converge to\nthe optimal policies theoretically, and its performance (i.e., energy cost,\nthermal comfort and on-line computation) for HVAC control via simulations. The\ncomparisons with the existing model predictive control based relaxation (MPC-R)\nmethod which is assumed with accurate future information and supposed to\nprovide the near-optimal bounds, show that though there exists some performance\nloss in energy cost reduction (i.e., 6.5%), the proposed method can enable\nefficient on-line implementation (less than 1 second) and provide high\nprobability of thermal comfort under uncertainties.",

    "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) is gaining momentum in its quest to bridge the\ngap between the physical and the digital world. The main goal of the IoT is the\ncreation of smart environments and self-aware things that help to facilitate a\nvariety of services such as smart transport, climate monitoring, e-health, etc.\nHuge volumes of data are expected to be collected by the connected\nsensors/things, which in traditional cases are processed centrally by large\ndata centers in the core network that will inevitably lead to excessive\ntransportation power consumption as well as added latency overheads. Instead,\nfog computing has been proposed by researchers from industry and academia to\nextend the capability of the cloud right to the point where the data is\ncollected at the sensing layer. This way, primitive tasks that can be hosted in\nIoT sensors do not need to be sent all the way to the cloud for processing. In\nthis paper we propose energy efficient embedding of machine learning (ML)\nmodels over a cloud-fog network using a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP)\noptimization model. We exploit virtualization in our framework to provide\nservice abstraction of Deep Neural Networks (DNN) layers that can be composed\ninto a set of VMs interconnected by virtual links. We constrain the number of\nVMs that can be processed at the IoT layer and study the impact on the\nperformance of the cloud fog approach.",

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the challenge of incentivizing energy-constrained,\nnon-cooperative user equipment (UE) to serve as cooperative relays. We consider\na source UE with a non-line-of-sight channel to an access point (AP), where\ndirect communication may be infeasible or may necessitate a substantial\ntransmit power. Other UEs in the vicinity are viewed as relay candidates, and\nour aim is to enable energy-efficient connectivity for the source, while\naccounting for the self-interested behavior and private channel state\ninformation of these candidates, by allowing the source to ``pay\" the\ncandidates via wireless power transfer (WPT). We propose a cooperation-inducing\nprotocol, inspired by Myerson auction theory, which ensures that candidates\ntruthfully report power requirements while minimizing the expected power used\nby the source. Through rigorous analysis, we establish the regularity of\nvaluations for lognormal fading channels, which allows for the efficient\ndetermination of the optimal source transmit power. Extensive simulation\nexperiments, employing real-world communication and WPT parameters, validate\nour theoretical framework. Our results demonstrate over 71% reduction in outage\nprobability with as few as 4 relay candidates, compared to the non-cooperative\nscenario, and as much as 70% source power savings compared to a baseline\napproach, highlighting the efficacy of our proposed methodology.",
