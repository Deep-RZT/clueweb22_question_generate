How do I use the cursors for my computer & xanga?

To install cursors check out our help page...

To install on Xanga, I'm not sure.  If they allow you to edit HTML paste the universal code between the <head></head> but after other CSS codes.

Click on one of the icons above, and then click on the "Tumblr" tab on the next page and follow the instructions.
