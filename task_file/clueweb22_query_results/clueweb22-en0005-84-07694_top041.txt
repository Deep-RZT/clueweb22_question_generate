Cigarette holder
These are brilliant as I smoke roll ups and used to get stains on my fingers,  and felt they were too strong and also wanted to cut down the amount of tar etc, these do it all, no stained fingers anymore, a smoother and milder smoke, and the filter collects all the tar. I can't smoke without these at all now.

Fab.. very recommended.
A "must have" item if u wanna reduce tar in ur lungs..!  Slightly weakens strength of pull & taste on ciggies, but thats becoz it filtering the "rubbish" ,& u can see all the collected tar in the cartridge!!  Also good if u trying to give up or minimise smoking. (Especially when u see the full cartridge, it quite. An incentive ). Have been smoking over 45 yrs,  been using one for years, & will always use one, till the time I decide to give up (if that day ever comes ðŸ˜‰)

Perfect ciggy holder
I have been using these for a few years now.  They are small enough to fit into a small tin along with your pre-rolled ciggys for the day.  The additional filter in them gives a smoother, less harsh smoke.

My main reason for using a holder is that I suffer badly with nicotine stains on my fingers with home rolled cigarettes and using one of these eliminates this completely.

For both reasons (as above) I highly recommend these cigarette holders.
