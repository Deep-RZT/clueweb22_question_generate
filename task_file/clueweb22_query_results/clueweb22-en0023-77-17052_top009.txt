Another cursor pack!
It contains 2 animated cursors - Luna-P turning around and the Moon Wand with shining Silver Crystal, which is also included in static version. These three were completely made by me. The Moon Kaleidoscope & Silence Glaive pics were from Google. Pluto´s rod is from here: superkawaiiemoticon.tumblr.com…
I got to warn you, they are so thin it´s almost impossible to recognize them.
Enjoy
