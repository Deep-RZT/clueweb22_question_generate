Vehicle Remote Starters
Remote car starter systems are very popular aftermarket automotive accessories and there are systems available for virtually every modern vehicle. These systems provide a convenient comfort by allowing the consumer to normalize
        the vehicle's internal temperature before getting in to drive. Furthermore, some consider these systems an essential safety feature in that they can allow a windshield to thaw on a cold winter morning, or prevent a child
        from being burnt by a hot seat belt on a hot summer day.
With advancing technology, remote start manufacturers have been able to drastically simplify a once complicated and frustrating installation process.    There are many different types
        of remote start systems available and determining the best option for each application can be frustrating and time consuming.
Remote Starter Types
OEM "Add-on" Remote Start
1-Button Remote Start
Remote Start with Keyless Entry
2-Way Remote Start
Remote Start with Car Alarm
Smartphone Remote Start
OEM "Add-on" Remote Start
OEM Add-on remote start systems use the vehicle's pre-existing remote control system to start the car, and therefore does not include remotes or an antenna. Once installed, the user will push a simple sequence of buttons on the
          factory remote to start the car (e.g lock x 3, or lock-unlock-lock).
Benefits:
This type of system will not require carrying an additional key fob for operation (this is especially relevant for vehicle that have the key built into the key fob)
This system is typically less expensive than other types of systems
Limitations:
Since the system works off of the factory keyless entry system the range of operation is limited to the range of the factory system, which is usually only a couple hundred feet.
Some vehicle makes (e.g. Honda, Toyota) have a keyless entry systems that are disabled if the vehicle is running.  This means that if you remote start your car, you will have to use the key to manually unlock when
            you get in.

Having your car warmed or cooled up already saves your time of waiting up to defrost or scrape windows before starting.
No One Can Access Your Vehicle
You can now be peaceful with your vehicle being locked while running without having the keys on it. Whether you’re in your driveway or a parking lot somewhere, no one can access your vehicle while it’s running and you’re not inside it. Isn’t it a great thing?
Another great thing about having remote starters is that they require your vehicle to be locked in order to use them. This way, you can keep your vehicle locked and safe every time you use it.

It increases the resale value of your car, especially when operated in an extreme climate area. If you wish to sell your car, remote starters make your job easier, and there’s a chance to regain the majority of your investment in it.
Safety & Security
Remote starters in your car provide you safety with starting your vehicle from a distance while going out at night. You can check if anyone is around or approaching your vehicle from a distance and unlock your vehicle. Remote starters ensure peace of mind and safety while allowing you to survey an area and approach the vehicle quickly.
Besides these significant benefits, remote starters also help in many other things such as:
