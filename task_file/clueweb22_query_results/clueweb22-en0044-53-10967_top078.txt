		50.5x
2-Way 
		Remote Start / Security System with Responder SST Technology
Responder SST Systems from Clifford are 
			simply the most advanced 2-Way Security and Remote Start systems in 
			the world! Responder SST Systems employ Spread Spectrum Technology, 
			digital frequency hopping and multiple frequency transmission to 
			assure that, if a frequency is blocked, the signal still goes 
			through. Responder SST also uses dual error correction systems to 
			combat signal data corruption and minimize signal interference.  
			The result is rock solid range of up to one full mile!  The 
			interactive display on the Responder Transmitter confirms 
			all commands - virtually instantly - with easy to understand icons, 
			plus text!  It alerts users to security system triggers by 
			beeping or vibrating when out of audible range of the siren. And of 
			course the Clifford 
			Matrix 50.5X will start your vehicle with the push of a 
			button, and you'll get confirmation back that it started, from up 
			to one mile away!
