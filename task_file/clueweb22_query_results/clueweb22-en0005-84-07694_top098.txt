Question:
What part of the product is the "cigar snuffer" (re: "there is a cigar snuffer that extinguishes your cigars immediately ")? How does it work?
Answer:
the entire tube snuffs the cigar - once you put the cigar in and close the cap, the air can no longer get to the cigar and the burn goes out - it is not immediate but it does not take long and once the cigar is in the snuffer, there is no more smoke

Question:
Will this work on Black and Mild cigars with the tip?
Answer:
It should all that really matters is the ring size.. I have only found one cigar it will not work on an it's huge...

Question:
Does this item get through tsa at airport ok?  anyone tried this - smoking outside, put it in, and go through tsa ok?
Answer:
I would imagine it is fine as long as it is "out" before you walk through security "burning" inside the tube. I take my cigars through all the time and have not had an issue with any of them that have been partially smoked.

Question:
What is the best way to keep it clean?
Answer:
If you cut your cigars above ash and let air out for about 30 min (if you can) before placing it will help with already smoked smell. If you can’t wait, cut cigar above ash and place inside. It holds the smell fairly well. But once you smoke the cigar already inside, it will smell, but let air out open for about a hour… see more
