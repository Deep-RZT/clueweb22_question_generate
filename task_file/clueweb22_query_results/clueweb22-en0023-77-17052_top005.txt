Option #1 - Universal CSS/HTML Code
This CSS/HTML Code of Usagi Sailor Moon works on almost every website or web page on the internet that allows, CSS and 
								HTML coding. Like forums, normal web page etc.
<style type="text/css">* {cursor: url(https://cur.cursors-4u.net/anime/ani-11/ani1074.cur), auto !important;}</style><a href="https://www.cursors-4u.com/cursor/2011/02/24/usagi-sailor-moon-15.html" target="_blank" title="Usagi Sailor Moon"><img src="https://cur.cursors-4u.net/cursor.png" border="0" alt="Usagi Sailor Moon" style="position:absolute; top: 0px; right: 0px;" /></a>
Option #2 - CSS Style Sheet Only Code
Option #2 is for website owners who are allowed to edit their CSS style sheet.  Paste this at the bottom of your style sheet. 
								If you don't know what CSS style sheet means, then use the above code.
/* Start https://www.cursors-4u.com */ * {cursor: url(https://cur.cursors-4u.net/anime/ani-11/ani1074.cur), auto !important;} /* End https://www.cursors-4u.com */

After the third option, the cursor showed up somewhat. It doesn't show up if you hover over the background or anything.
