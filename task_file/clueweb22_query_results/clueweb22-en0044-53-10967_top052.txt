SmartSchedule
Part weatherman, part mind reader.
Clifford SmartStart's new SmartSchedule is patent-pending technology that sends smart, behavior-based reminders to you when it’s time to start your car. SmartSchedule triangulates scheduling, weather and location data to generate these predictive start reminders.
SmartSchedule allows you to establish your commute time and temperature parameters – and the new cloud-based feature is very easy to set up. Enter your daily routine into the SmartSchedule section of the app (including what days you work and normal commute times) – and the app will take care of the rest.
The app will continuously monitor the temperature, location and scheduling variables from the cloud. Clifford SmartStart will ping you with alerts when appropriate.
Vehicle Status
Did you accidentally leave your door open? Is your trunk popped? The Status Updates feature on the Clifford SmartStart app will let you know.
The app offers real-time car status and unprecedented two-way connectivity. Not only can you locate your vehicle with GPS – but also know that it’s running, armed, locked, and much more!
Whether out to dinner, relaxing at the beach, or sitting in the top-most upper deck at the ballgame, Clifford SmartStart lets you keep tabs on your vehicle around the clock, no matter where you go – all from your smartphone with simple confirmation reporting.
