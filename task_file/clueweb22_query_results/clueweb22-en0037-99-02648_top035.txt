Kata and George
Casares Costa is beautiful. The combination of the seashore and the mountains virtually minutes away is just a bonus. La Perla de la Bahia is a beautiful, well planned development, offering lots of privacy.

Highlights of Casares Costa
Casares Costa
Casares Costa is a small stretch of coast, which forms part of the municipality of Casares in the province of Malaga, Andalusia. Situated beachside the area is an ideal destination for a family beach holiday, situated in fairly relaxed surroundings, yet enjoying local amenities, and within a short distance of Estepona, Sotogrande and Gibraltar.
Local Casares
Casares is split into two urban area: Casares Costa, which is a beach-side strip of residential urbanisations, a commercial centre and bars and restaurants and the old historical village of Casares, which is located some kilometres up into the mountains, sitting 430 metres above sea-level.
Places to visit
Casares Costa is well situated to explore the western end of the Costa del Sol, from Marbella and Estepona, down to Sotogrande, Gibraltar and into the Cadiz province.
The area offers lots of facilities and amenities for those looking to take part in leisure activities such as water sports, jeep safaris, inland excursions, trekking, or simply sit and relax at a beach bar and enjoy Sardines al espeto (Sardines on the Spit) and a glass of vino or sangria.
Golf
Casares Costa is an excellent destination for golf holidays, or those looking to partake in a round or two whilst away. In close proximity are a number of world-class courses, including La Duquesa Golf & Country Club, Estepona Golf, Valderrama (Sotogrande) and Alcaidesa Links Golf in San Roque.
Beaches
Golden sand beaches stretch along from Estepona, to Casares and onto Sotogrande and Gibraltar, and never get over crowded. You can walk to the beach from any location in Casares Costa, and there are wonderful chiringuitos (beach restaurants) dotted along the way.
Climate
Casares Costa enjoys a sub-tropical Mediterranean climate, with hot summers and mild winters. Cooling breezes from the sea make the summer heat manageable, temperatures average 32 ºC during the summer and 15-16º during the winter months.

Costa del Sol reviews
There are soooooo many things to do on Costa del Sol. One minute one can walk on the beach, half an our later you can be climbing up the beautiful narrow street to the top of the Village of Casares. From Malaga to Cadiz there are great towns, wonderful restaurants, fascinating markets, splendid small harbours, wonderful people. This is just a wonderful part of Spain.

Boring. Casares (the white village) itself is very nice.

Not very inviting. I've seen much cleaner and more inviting beaches in Andalusie.
