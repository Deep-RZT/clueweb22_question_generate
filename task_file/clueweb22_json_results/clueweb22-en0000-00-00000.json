The telescope is an optical instrument that uses lenses, curved mirrors, or a combination of the two to see distant objects or other devices that employ electromagnetic radiation to observe distant objects by their emission, absorption, or reflection, interesting facts about telescopes. Refracting telescopes, which used glass lenses and were created in the Netherlands at the beginning of the 17th century, were the earliest known functional telescopes. These were employed for both terrestrial and astronomical purposes.\nWithin a few decades following the original refracting telescope, the reflecting telescope was created, which collects and focuses light using mirrors. Many new types of telescopes were created in the twentieth century, interesting facts about telescopes, including radio telescopes in the 1930s and infrared telescopes in the 1960s. The term “telescope” currently encompasses a wide range of equipment capable of detecting various parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, as well as other types of detectors in some situations.\nSoon after the creation of the refracting telescope, the concept that the objective, or light-gathering element, maybe a mirror instead of a lens was explored, interesting facts about telescopes. The theoretical benefits of utilizing parabolic mirrors—the decrease of spherical aberration and the absence of chromatic aberration—led to a slew of suggested designs and efforts to create reflecting telescopes. In 1668, Isaac Newton created the first functional reflecting telescope, the Newtonian reflector, which bears his name.\nThe achromatic lens was invented in 1733 and allowed for the development of shorter, more practical refracting telescopes by partially correcting color distortions found in the simple lens, interesting facts about telescopes. Reflecting telescopes were impeded by the use of quickly tarnishing speculum metal mirrors in the 18th and early 19th centuries, which was solved by the advent of silver-coated glass mirrors in 1857 and aluminized mirrors in 1932.\nBecause refracting telescopes have a physical size limit of roughly 1 meter (40 inches), the great majority of large optical research telescopes produced since the beginning of the twentieth century have been reflectors, interesting facts about telescopes. The biggest reflecting telescopes now have objectives bigger than 10 m (33 ft), and numerous 30-40m versions are in the works.\nThe Hale 60-inch research reflecting telescope (debuted in 1908) is regarded as the first contemporary big research reflecting telescope.\nInteresting facts about telescopes\n1. Although this cannot be proven, it is currently thought that Galileo’s blindness was caused by a combination of glaucoma and cataracts, which he contracted while staring at the sun through his telescope.\n2. The Kepler Space Telescope discovered a star 500 times the size of the sun in March 2016, a supernova 1.2 billion light-years distant.\n3. The telescope was apparently used for more than just gazing at the skies or merely looking at birds. Early telescopes were marketed for a different purpose back in the day. Merchants used them to spot approaching trade ships in order to beat the competition.\n4. The oldest known documentation of a telescope is a patent for a refracting telescope filed to the Dutch government in 1608 by Middelburg spectacle manufacturer Hans Lippershey. Although the exact creator is unknown, knowledge of the invention traveled throughout Europe. Galileo learned of it and created his own version in 1609, using it to make telescopic observations of celestial objects.\n5. Telescopes that functioned in a wide variety of wavelengths from radio to gamma-rays were also developed throughout the twentieth century. In 1937, the first purpose-built radio telescope was put into service. Since then, a wide range of sophisticated astronomy devices has been created.\n6. In South Africa and Australia, a new radio telescope is being erected. It is anticipated that a large amount of data would be generated. It will surpass global internet traffic, which is no minor feat. Every day, this radio telescope will create one exabyte of raw data. According to experts, the data can be reduced to 10 petabytes each day.\n7. The Humble Space Telescope is the moniker given to Canada’s first space telescope, the Microvariability and Oscillations of Stars (MOST).\n8. The Gran Telescopio Canarias, the world’s biggest operational telescope, is located on the Canary Islands. The construction of the 34-foot-wide telescope took almost a decade (10 meters).\n9. The Leviathan of Parsonstown, built in Ireland, held the title of world’s biggest telescope for more than seven decades. The 40-ton telescope was unfortunately remained shut down owing to the rain. The Earl of Rosse erected this telescope in 1845.\n10. Everything nowadays includes a small amount of technology. The majority of professional astronomers utilize Internet-based telescopes to examine various celestial objects. These telescopes are controlled by computers from afar.\n11. Pope Paul saw the moon from the Vatican Observatory during the Apollo Moon Landing mission in 1969, before watching the broadcast moonwalk.\n12. Jack Black, the comedian, actor, and all-around hilarious guy, has parents who worked as satellite engineers on the HST.\n13. These two appear to have something in common. His parents were both engineers, and his mother worked on the Hubble Space Telescope’s design.\n14. NASA, for one, is not giving up the race. They intend to construct a radio telescope on the Moon. They want to complete it by 2030.\n15. The Large Binocular Telescope is a binocular-like telescope made up of two telescopes that are parallel to one another.\n16. When talking about telescopes, the phrase “First Light” is used to describe the first time a telescope observes the sky.\n17. The first known illustration of a telescope is a sketch included in a 1609 letter. Giovanbattista Della Porta created it.\n18. The Hubble Space Telescope was launched more than seven years late, in 1990. The fact that the telescope’s light-collecting mirror had to be polished for a year to an accuracy of no more than 10 nanometers was one of the reasons for its delayed debut. Unfortunately, the folks in charge of polishing the mirror performed a poor job. They removed 2,200 nanometers from it. After corrective lenses were installed in 1993, the Hubble Telescope became the source of about 25% of astronomy research articles.\n19. Infrared telescopes use infrared radiation, sometimes known as heat waves, to generate pictures. Infrared radiation are emitted by all things, although warmer items emit more than colder ones. On Earth, the majority of infrared telescopes are reflectors with a bowl-shaped mirror. Infrared rays are blocked by gases in the atmosphere, thus they are generally erected high on mountains.\n20. Chile dominates the top ten list of the world’s largest telescopes, accounting for half of the total. They also have the bottom half of the population, with four people living at the Paranal Observatory.\n21. One of the world’s biggest telescopes, located on Mt. Graham in Arizona, resembles a pair of gigantic binoculars. The Large Binocular Telescope is made up of two side-by-side telescopes that are each 28 feet (8.4 meters) wide.\n22. The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) orbits the Earth at almost 17,000 mph (27,300 km/h), nearly 22 times faster than the Land Speed World Record for the fastest automobile ever set.\n23. China is the first country on the Moon to have a robotic telescope. The telescope has been operational since 2013, with scientists estimating that it may last up to 30 years.\n24. Galileo did not develop the telescope, but he did use it to make numerous breakthrough discoveries.\n25. UV telescopes are used to investigate space objects that emit ultraviolet (UV) radiation, such as the sun and freshly created stars. Most UV telescopes are installed on space satellites because the ozone layer filters most UV photons that reach Earth.\n26. Hans Lippershey is said to have created the telescope around 1608. At least, that’s what the prevailing wisdom claims. Several tales, on the other hand, claim that a group of children found the telescope while playing with lenses in a sight shop. Which one do you believe is correct?\n27. Galileo was the first to point the telescope skyward. He is responsible for the discovery of Jupiter’s satellites as well as the moon’s craters. Unfortunately, he used the telescope to stare directly at the Sun. This event is said to have caused his blindness.\n28. When a new telescope is directed on the sky for the first time, it is referred to as “First Light.”\n29. Hubble has generated about 45 terabytes of data, which is enough to fill over 5,800 DVD movies.\n30. The Hubble Space Telescope has traveled over 3 billion miles and made over 1.2 million observations since its launch in 1990. At 17,900 mph, it circles 340 miles above Earth. It would take a car that quick to go from coast to coast in the United States in 10 minutes.\n31. In 1983, astronomer Edwin P. Hubble was honored with the Hubble Space Telescope.\n32. Light collecting, resolving, and magnifying are the three basic functions of telescopes.\n33. A telescope’s aperture, or the diameter of its lens or mirror, is the single most significant element in deciding how effectively it will function. The brightness and clarity of its pictures are determined by its aperture.\n34. In 1990, the Hubble Space Telescope was launched. Although it was seven years late and over budget, it has become the source of around 25% of all published astronomical articles.\n35. One of the most important devices of the Industrial Revolution was the telescope.\n36. The clarity of planets, their surfaces and characteristics, and other astronomical wonders are a bigger drive than distance when building a telescope. We can see millions of light-years away, but the clarity of planets, their surfaces and characteristics, and other astronomical wonders are a bigger drive.\n37. Earth 2.0 is the moniker given to a planet found in 2015 by the Kepler Telescope that is said to be one of the most similar to Earth.\n38. The HST captured a well-known picture known as the Pillars of Creation. This may no longer exist; but, owing to the speed of light, it is expected that humans will be able to view it for another millennia.\n39. In visible, ultraviolet, and infrared light, the Hubble Space Telescope can see objects in space. Hubble is controlled by NASA astronomers using radio orders from the ground.\n40. Galileo used his telescope to discover Jupiter’s satellites as well as the craters on Earth’s moon. He also used his telescope to see the sun, which may have contributed to his subsequent blindness.\n41. Earth and Mercury are the only planets in the solar system that the Hubble Space Telescope has not photographed. Mercury is too near to the sun for Hubble to obtain a good image, and Hubble’s sensors would be damaged by the planet’s powerful reflected light.\n42. Wernher Von Braun’s interest in astronomy may have sprung from his mother. Wernher’s mother gave him his first telescope instead of a conventional present for his Lutheran confirmation.\n43. Karl Guthe Janksy, a Bell Telephone Laboratories employee, created the world’s first radio telescope in 1930; the merry-go-round was built to assist discover the origin of static interference for radios.\n44. NASA’s Kepler telescope identified the most Earth-like planet yet discovered in 2015. This possibly water-bearing planet, dubbed “Earth 2.0,” is 1,400 light years away from Earth 1.0.\n45. Arecibo, on the island of Puerto Rico, is home to the world’s largest radio telescope dish, which is housed in a rainforest depression. The diameter of the dish is 1,000 feet. Because a radio transmission contains less information than a light beam, radio telescopes are massive.\n46. The Compton Gamma Ray Observatory (CGRO) was built to detect photons and cost a whopping $617 million to build. In April of 1991, it was launched into space.\n47. While lenses had been known to ancient Greeks and Islamic academics for centuries, they were not introduced to Europe until the 13th century. Telescopes were not created until the 17th century for unclear reasons.\n48. Thousands of images have been obtained by the Hubble Space Telescope, but the “Pillars of Creation” is arguably the most renowned. In the faraway Eagle Nebula, the pillars are enormous clouds of gas and dust.\n49. Herschel, with its 11.5-foot (3.5-meter) primary mirror, is the world’s biggest infrared space telescope. It has studied star formation in galaxy clusters, found a chemical necessary for producing water in dying stars like the sun, and conducted a large-scale cosmic dust survey since it was launched in 2009.\n50. The term “Extremely Large Telescope” (ELT) refers to a specific type of telescope. The European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT), the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT), the Giant Magellan Telescope (GMT), the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT), and the Gran Telescopio Canarias are among the existing or soon-to-be-built ELTs (GTC).\nWe hope you have enjoyed these interesting facts about telescopes!\nMore Interesting Articles\n24 Great Inventions in the 60s That Still Exist\n7 Easy Steps to Have the License for A New Invention\n45 Cool Future Inventions – Sci-Fi, Prediction, or Reality?\n120 World’s Greatest Inventions of the Last 100 Years\nAutomation Challenges Factors and How to Overcome\n16 Digital Transformation Trends in 2021 and Beyond\n25 Predictions of Bad Inventions in the Future\n35 Most Important Evergreen Inventions of All Time\n50 Greatest Inventions of the 21st Century\n40 Futuristic Inventions – A Prediction on Future Technologies\n10 Excellent Inventions of the 2000s Timeline\n30 Remarkable Inventions Made from 2000 to 2019\n10 Steps to Learn How to Make An Invention\n10 Popular Inventions in the Golden 1970s\n20 Examples of Artificial Intelligence in Daily Life\n30 Interesting Scientific Inventions and Discoveries\n70 Inventions Made in America – Great US Inventions\n35 Inventions Made by Accident – Accidental Inventions\nPermanent Artificial Heart – History | Mechanism | Options\n10 Top Inventions in the 80s that Gained Huge Popularity\nTags\ntelescope facts\nhubble telescope facts\njames webb telescope facts\nhubble space telescope facts\nedwin hubble facts\narecibo observatory facts\ngalileo telescope facts\nradio telescope facts\nfun facts about telescopes\nhubble facts\nvery large array facts\ninteresting facts about telescopes\nspitzer space telescope facts\ninteresting facts about edwin hubble\njames webb space telescope facts\nwilliam herschel facts\nkepler telescope facts\nedwin hubble fun facts\ninteresting facts about the hubble telescope\nreflecting telescope facts\nthirty meter telescope facts\nchandra telescope facts\nkeck telescope facts\narecibo message facts\ninteresting facts about hubble space telescope\nrefracting telescope facts\nfun facts about the hubble telescope\nfacts about galileo’s telescope\ninteresting facts about william herschel\nfun facts about the hubble space telescope\nhans lippershey facts\n68 total views ,  3 views today",

It is this that makes it so useful and versatile for use on land and at sea. Not only have many different types of telescope been made in the last four centuries, but telescopic enhancements have also been used on many other instruments and accessories.\nVisit the Royal Observatory to see its diverse collection of telescope types and functions, including the telescope with which James Bradley discovered the aberration of light, telescopes for amateur and professional astronomers, and telescopes for everyday use on land and at sea.\nBrowse our collections\n0:30\nThe invention of the telescope\nHistorians are not absolutely sure who invented the telescope, but it is known that in 1608 a Dutch spectacle maker, Hans Lipperhey, announced a new lens-based seeing instrument that made distant objects appear much closer. This is the first evidence we have of the invention of the telescope, the first scientific instrument to extend one of the human senses.\nThe use of the telescope in astronomy\nSince then, the telescope has evolved as a key scientific instrument that has changed our perception of the world and the universe around us. It was in astronomy, in particular, that the telescope had an enormous impact, starting with the discoveries of Galileo Galilei whose work began to change our understanding of the universe.\nThe work that Galileo began was continued by observatories such as the Royal Observatory at Greenwich in the centuries that followed. Telescopes naturally found a home in observatories throughout the world, though most telescopes have been made for everyday use at sea and on land.\nGalileo's findings\nAfter hearing about what Lipperhey had revealed in the Netherlands, Galileo made his own telescope.\nDespite this, Galileo became known for his findings from his telescopic observations. These included:\nJupiter's four moons\nThat the Earth's moon was not spherical\nThe terrain of the moon, and it's similarity in geological make up to Earth\nThat sun was the centre of the universe and not the Earth, as people thought\nAlthough Galileo became renowned for these discoveries, it was actually English astronomer Thomas Harriot who first drew the Moon from his telescope observations, on 26 July 1609.\nHarriot's drawings were more cartographical than Galileo’s, marking out the difference in light and shade as a map of the Earth might mark out water and land.\nTelescope in society\nTelescopes were not just for the astronomers and scientists of the world however. They were popular tools to simply observe the Moon closer than had been possible before.\nSir William Lower wrote to Harriot after examining the Moon through his own telescope, which he referred to as his ‘cylinder’.\n“in the full she appears like a tarte that my cooke made last weeke.”\nSatirical images of the telescope\nThe prevalence of the telescope on land, at sea and in the study of the heavens made it a readily recognisable instrument, but also an easy object for satire.\nIn the 18th and 19th centuries in particular, many satirical images used the telescope to make fun of science and its practitioners, as well as of military and political figures and in commentaries on society and its problems.",

His telescope had improvements and he presented his telescope to the venetian senate. Galileo was also first to use his telescope on space and was able to view mountains and craters on the moon. His telescope allowed him to discover more information about space.  Later on Issac Newton working with Johannes Kepler stated that telescopes would be much better with reflection which was very true since very powerful telescopes used reflection\nTelescopes are an instrument used to make objects from far distances appear closer. They use a series  lenses (For refraction) or curved mirrors (For reflection). Telescopes collect and bends it into the focus giving you a magnified image.\nSources\nMicroscopes importance\nallows us to look closer\nOther than telescopes, microscopes are also very important in science and have changed many things. Some of the things it done or changed is..\nThe space hubble telescope is a telescope located\nin space. The telescope was built in 1990 and was named after Edwin Hubble (Proposed the Hubble Law). The reason it was built in space was because there's distortion and twinkling in the photos due to earth's atmosphere. The Telescope allows you to take clearer images of celestial planets, stars etc. It is located in earths atmosphere and is solar powered. Although it wasn't the first space telescope, the telescope has given sharp pictures that allows scientist to learn much more about space. The telescope uses a series of mirrors and focuses the light to create a\nmagnified image.\nTo understand our bodies\nChanges/Improvements\nThe  microscope has gone through many changes. Some of the changes include Robert Hooke discovering pores and skin cells by accident which started the use for biology. Another change is the microscope allowing Anton Van Leeuwenhoek to describe bacteria. We've also had changes such as new kinds of microscopes such as the electron microsope  made by Ernest Ruska. An electron microsope is a microscope that uses an electron beam to light up a specimen for a magnified image of the specimen.\nSimilar to the invention of the telescope, there was confusion wether it was invented by Hans Lippershey (Credited with the invention of the telescope) or Hans and Zacharias Janssen. It was then credited to Zacharias Jansenn. It is believed that Zacharias inventd the compound and optical telescope with the help of his father or entirely done by his father with the purpose of trying to help people with very poor eyesight.\nMicroscopes allow us to view small objects that can't be seen by the eye with the use of lenses. There are many kinds of microscopes but the first and most common is the optical microscope. It works by having a condenser lens focusing light on the sample/specimen. The objective lens then magnifies the beam of light which allows the projector lens to have a larger image appear for the viewer\nhttp://www.howstuffworks.com/telescope1.htm\nhttp://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/9-12/features/telescope_feature_912.html\nhttp://www.space.com/21950-who-invented-the-telescope.html\nhttp://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/5-8/features/what-is-the-hubble-space-telecope-58.html#.UpwdyWRDug4\nThe Space Hubble Telescope\nWhat do Microscopes do?
