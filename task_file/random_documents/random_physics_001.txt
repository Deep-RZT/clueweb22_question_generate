Abstract: We report on the enhancement of the spin coherence time (T2) by almost an
order-of-magnitude in exciton-polariton condensates through driven spin
precession resonance. Using a rotating optical trap formed by a bichromatic
laser excitation, we synchronize the trap stirring frequency with the
condensate intrinsic Larmor precession, achieving an order of magnitude
increase in spin coherence. By tuning the optical trap profile via excitation
lasers intensity, we precisely control the resonance width. Here we present a
theoretical model that explains our experimental findings in terms of the
mutual synchronization of the condensate circular polarization components. Our
findings underpin the potential of polariton condensates for spinoptronic
devices and quantum technologies.
