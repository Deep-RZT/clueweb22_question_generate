Abstract: Spectral imaging offers promising applications across diverse domains,
including medicine and urban scene understanding, and is already established as
a critical modality in remote sensing. However, variability in channel
dimensionality and captured wavelengths among spectral cameras impede the
development of AI-driven methodologies, leading to camera-specific models with
limited generalizability and inadequate cross-camera applicability. To address
this bottleneck, we introduce $\textbf{CARL}$, a model for
$\textbf{C}$amera-$\textbf{A}$gnostic $\textbf{R}$epresentation
$\textbf{L}$earning across RGB, multispectral, and hyperspectral imaging
modalities. To enable the conversion of a spectral image with any channel
dimensionality to a camera-agnostic embedding, we introduce wavelength
positional encoding and a self-attention-cross-attention mechanism to compress
spectral information into learned query representations. Spectral-spatial
pre-training is achieved with a novel spectral self-supervised JEPA-inspired
strategy tailored to CARL. Large-scale experiments across the domains of
medical imaging, autonomous driving, and satellite imaging demonstrate our
model's unique robustness to spectral heterogeneity, outperforming on datasets
with simulated and real-world cross-camera spectral variations. The scalability
and versatility of the proposed approach position our model as a backbone for
future spectral foundation models.
