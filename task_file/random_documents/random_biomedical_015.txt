Abstract: In mass spectrometry-based proteomics, experts usually project data onto a
single set of reference sequences, overlooking the influence of common
haplotypes (combinations of genetic variants inherited together from a parent).
We recently introduced ProHap, a tool for generating customized protein
haplotype databases. Here, we present ProHap Explorer, a visualization
interface designed to investigate the influence of common haplotypes on the
human proteome. It enables users to explore haplotypes, their effects on
protein sequences, and the identification of non-canonical peptides in public
mass spectrometry datasets. The design builds on well-established
representations in biological sequence analysis, ensuring familiarity for
domain experts while integrating novel interactive elements tailored to
proteogenomic data exploration. User interviews with proteomics experts
confirmed the tool's utility, highlighting its ability to reveal whether
haplotypes affect proteins of interest. By facilitating the intuitive
exploration of proteogenomic variation, ProHap Explorer supports research in
personalized medicine and the development of targeted therapies.
