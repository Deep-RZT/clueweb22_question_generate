Abstract: The Poynting effect is a paragon of nonlinear soft matter mechanics. It is
the tendency (found in all incompressible, isotropic, hyperelastic solids)
exhibited by a soft block to expand vertically when sheared horizontally. It
can be observed whenever the length of the cuboid is at least four times its
thickness. Here we show that the Poynting effect can be easily reversed and the
cuboid can shrink vertically, simply by reducing this aspect ratio. In
principle, this discovery means that for a given solid, say one used as a
seismic wave absorber under a building, an optimal ratio exists where vertical
displacements and vibrations can be completely eliminated. Here we first recall
the classical theoretical treatment of the positive Poynting effect, and then
show experimentally how it can be reversed. Using Finite Element simulations,
we then investigate how the effect can be suppressed. We find that cubes always
provide a reverse Poynting effect, irrespective of their material properties
(in the third-order theory of weakly nonlinear elasticity).
