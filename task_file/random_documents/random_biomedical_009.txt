Authors: Achal Mahajan, Erik J. Navarro, William Poole, Carlos F Lopez

Abstract: Essential life processes take place across multiple space and time scales in
living organisms but understanding their mechanistic interactions remains an
ongoing challenge. Advanced multiscale modeling techniques are providing new
opportunities and insights into these complex processes. In cells, meters of
chromatin are folded into a nucleus with a diameter on the order of microns.
The three-dimensional chromatin structure coupled with biochemical processes
that turn genes on or off, specify a given cell type through a complicated set
of interactions collectively referred to as epigenetics. Important epigenetic
processes include the differential accessibility of genomic loci to
transcription factors and chemical modifications to DNA and DNA-binding
molecules such as histones. The dynamics of these epigenetic processes span
timescales from milliseconds to years. How do chemical modifications consisting
of a handful of atoms cooperate to modulate genome folding at the scale of the
nucleus and impact organism outcomes? In this review, we highlight the
inherently multiscale nature of chromatin organization, with a focus on
computational modeling to bridge the gaps in our understanding of biochemical
processes across scales. We review relevant chromatin biology, including major
types of epigenetic modifications as well as the higher order chromatin
structures to present a multiscale view of chromatin. We also review relevant
computational methods to simulate chromatin structure, function, and dynamics,
as well as experimental techniques that inform and validate said models.
Finally, we argue that multiscale modeling provides a path forward towards
understanding emergent behavior in this inherently multiscale system.
