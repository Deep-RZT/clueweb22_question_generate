Abstract: We present an improved version of the Superscaling Analysis with Relativistic
Effective Mass, denoted as SuSAM-v2. In the original SuSAM model, a universal
scaling function was fitted to a selected set of quasielastic electron
scattering (e,e') cross section data, using a phenomenological ansatz inspired
by the Relativistic Mean Field model of nuclear matter. In this work, we refine
the procedure by first fitting a longitudinal scaling function directly to
experimental longitudinal response data. Subsequently, a separate transverse
scaling function is extracted from purely transverse data, after subtracting
the longitudinal contribution already determined. We find that the resulting
transverse scaling function must exhibit an explicit dependence on the momentum
transfer q in order to reproduce all kinematics consistently. The resulting
SuSAM-v2 model simultaneously describes inclusive quasielastic cross sections
and both longitudinal and transverse response functions in electron scattering.
The model is then applied to neutrino-nucleus scattering, showing an improved
prediction compared to the previous SuSAM-v1 version, due to a more accurate
treatment of the relative contributions of the longitudinal and transverse weak
nuclear responses.
