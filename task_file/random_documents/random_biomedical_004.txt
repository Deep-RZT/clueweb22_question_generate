Abstract: Viral mutations pose significant threats to public health by increasing
infectivity, strengthening vaccine resistance, and altering disease severity.
To track these evolving patterns, agencies like the CDC annually evaluate
thousands of virus strains, underscoring the urgent need to understand viral
mutagenesis and evolution in depth. In this study, we integrate genomic
analysis, clustering, and three leading dimensionality reduction approaches,
namely, principal component analysis (PCA), t-distributed stochastic neighbor
embedding (t-SNE), and uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP)-to
investigate the effects of COVID-19 on influenza virus propagation. By applying
these methods to extensive pre- and post-pandemic influenza datasets, we reveal
how selective pressures during the pandemic have influenced the diversity of
influenza genetics. Our findings indicate that combining robust dimension
reduction with clustering yields critical insights into the complex dynamics of
viral mutation, informing both future research directions and strategies for
public health intervention.
