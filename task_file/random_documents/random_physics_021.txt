  Extensional Flow

Authors: Mingchao Wang, Stephen Sanderson, Debra J. Searles

Abstract: Complex flow fields govern the deformation of polymers in various
manufacturing processes. However, high flow rates may trigger reaction events
(i.e., bond breaking or undesirable reaction of mechanophores) in raw polymeric
materials, leading to the mechanical or functional debasement of manufactured
structures. Additionally, it is difficult to fully characterize such
molecular-level flow in the laboratory due to time- and length-scale limits. In
this study, we perform non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations to
explore the rheological and mechanical degradation of unentangled polymer melts
under uniaxial extensional flow (UEF), allowing for chain breaking. Our
simulations demonstrate shear thickening-thinning-thickening stages with the
increase of UEF extension rates, resulting from flow-induced changes of chain
conformation. With further increasing UEF extension rates, a bond-breaking
potential leads to another flow thinning stage. Interestingly, fracture
kinetics is originally first-order owing to the need for highly stretched
polymer chains before bond fracture. It is no longer first-order when bond
fracture is instigated before chains are stretched. Our computational work
provides insight into the optimal design of the manufacturing process for
polymeric materials.
