Abstract: Rydberg-assisted atomic electrometry with thermal vapors offers a promising
approach for detecting external electric fields. However, this technique
presents significant challenges for measuring low frequencies due to the
effects of metal-alkali atoms adsorbed on the interior surface of the vacuum
chamber. In this work, we apply high-contrast Rydberg electromagnetically
induced transparency (EIT) spectroscopy to systematically investigate these
effects, including the influence of laser power and electric field strength. We
demonstrate the ability to measure electric field frequencies ranging from 10
Hz to 1 MHz. Additionally, this study identifies a fundamental limit for data
capacity in such measurements. Furthermore, we propose a method for precise
Stark shift measurements by locking the coupling laser to Zeeman-split Rydberg
EIT peaks. Using the Zeeman shift in a reference cell as a stable frequency
reference, we track Stark-induced shifts in a science cell and confirm
excellent agreement with theoretical predictions. These results provide
valuable insights for future precision measurement techniques and field sensing
applications based on Rydberg atom systems.
