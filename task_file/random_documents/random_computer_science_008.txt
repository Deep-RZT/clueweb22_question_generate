Abstract: Most of the widely used estimators of the average treatment effect (ATE) in
causal inference rely on the assumptions of unconfoundedness and overlap.
Unconfoundedness requires that the observed covariates account for all
correlations between the outcome and treatment. Overlap requires the existence
of randomness in treatment decisions for all individuals. Nevertheless, many
types of studies frequently violate unconfoundedness or overlap, for instance,
observational studies with deterministic treatment decisions -- popularly known
as Regression Discontinuity designs -- violate overlap.
  In this paper, we initiate the study of general conditions that enable the
identification of the average treatment effect, extending beyond
unconfoundedness and overlap. In particular, following the paradigm of
statistical learning theory, we provide an interpretable condition that is
sufficient and nearly necessary for the identification of ATE. Moreover, this
condition characterizes the identification of the average treatment effect on
the treated (ATT) and can be used to characterize other treatment effects as
well. To illustrate the utility of our condition, we present several
well-studied scenarios where our condition is satisfied and, hence, we prove
that ATE can be identified in regimes that prior works could not capture. For
example, under mild assumptions on the data distributions, this holds for the
models proposed by Tan (2006) and Rosenbaum (2002), and the Regression
Discontinuity design model introduced by Thistlethwaite and Campbell (1960).
For each of these scenarios, we also show that, under natural additional
assumptions, ATE can be estimated from finite samples.
  We believe these findings open new avenues for bridging learning-theoretic
insights and causal inference methodologies, particularly in observational
studies with complex treatment mechanisms.
