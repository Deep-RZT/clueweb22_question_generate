Title: Proteome-wide prediction of mode of inheritance and molecular mechanism
  underlying genetic diseases using structural interactomics

Authors: Ali Saadat, Jacques Fellay

Abstract: Genetic diseases can be classified according to their modes of inheritance
and their underlying molecular mechanisms. Autosomal dominant disorders often
result from DNA variants that cause loss-of-function, gain-of-function, or
dominant-negative effects, while autosomal recessive diseases are primarily
linked to loss-of-function variants. In this study, we introduce a
graph-of-graphs approach that leverages protein-protein interaction networks
and high-resolution protein structures to predict the mode of inheritance of
diseases caused by variants in autosomal genes, and to classify
dominant-associated proteins based on their functional effect. Our approach
integrates graph neural networks, structural interactomics and topological
network features to provide proteome-wide predictions, thus offering a scalable
method for understanding genetic disease mechanisms.
