    "title": "Struct2D: A Perception-Guided Framework for Spatial Reasoning in Large\n  Multimodal Models",
    "content": "Unlocking spatial reasoning in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) is crucial for\nenabling intelligent interaction with 3D environments. While prior efforts\noften rely on explicit 3D inputs or specialized model architectures, we ask:\ncan LMMs reason about 3D space using only structured 2D representations derived\nfrom perception? We introduce Struct2D, a perception-guided prompting framework\nthat combines bird's-eye-view (BEV) images with object marks and object-centric\nmetadata, optionally incorporating egocentric keyframes when needed. Using\nStruct2D, we conduct an in-depth zero-shot analysis of closed-source LMMs\n(e.g., GPT-o3) and find that they exhibit surprisingly strong spatial reasoning\nabilities when provided with structured 2D inputs, effectively handling tasks\nsuch as relative direction estimation and route planning. Building on these\ninsights, we construct Struct2D-Set, a large-scale instruction tuning dataset\nwith 200K fine-grained QA pairs across eight spatial reasoning categories,\ngenerated automatically from 3D indoor scenes. We fine-tune an open-source LMM\n(Qwen2.5VL) on Struct2D-Set, achieving competitive performance on multiple\nbenchmarks, including 3D question answering, dense captioning, and object\ngrounding. Our approach demonstrates that structured 2D inputs can effectively\nbridge perception and language reasoning in LMMs-without requiring explicit 3D\nrepresentations as input. We will release both our code and dataset to support\nfuture research.",

    "content": "Learning robot control policies from human videos is a promising direction\nfor scaling up robot learning.

In this paper, we propose to use object-centric 3D motion field\nto represent actions for robot learning from human videos, and present a novel\nframework for extracting this representation from videos for zero-shot control.\nWe introduce two novel components in its implementation. First, a novel\ntraining pipeline for training a ''denoising'' 3D motion field estimator to\nextract fine object 3D motions from human videos with noisy depth robustly.\nSecond, a dense object-centric 3D motion field prediction architecture that\nfavors both cross-embodiment transfer and policy generalization to background.\nWe evaluate the system in real world setups.

    "content": "Inspired by the remarkable reasoning capabilities of Deepseek-R1 in complex\ntextual tasks, many works attempt to incentivize similar capabilities in\nMultimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by directly applying reinforcement\nlearning (RL). However, they still struggle to activate complex reasoning. In\nthis paper, rather than examining multimodal RL in isolation, we delve into\ncurrent training pipelines and identify three crucial phenomena: 1) Effective\ncold start initialization is critical for enhancing MLLM reasoning.\nIntriguingly, we find that initializing with carefully selected text data alone\ncan lead to performance surpassing many recent multimodal reasoning models,\neven before multimodal RL. 2) Standard GRPO applied to multimodal RL suffers\nfrom gradient stagnation, which degrades training stability and performance. 3)\nSubsequent text-only RL training, following the multimodal RL phase, further\nenhances multimodal reasoning. This staged training approach effectively\nbalances perceptual grounding and cognitive reasoning development. By\nincorporating the above insights and addressing multimodal RL issues, we\nintroduce ReVisual-R1, achieving a new state-of-the-art among open-source 7B\nMLLMs on challenging benchmarks including MathVerse, MathVision, WeMath,\nLogicVista, DynaMath, and challenging AIME2024 and AIME2025.",

    "title": "Pseudo-Simulation for Autonomous Driving",
    "content": "Existing evaluation paradigms for Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) face critical\nlimitations. Real-world evaluation is often challenging due to safety concerns\nand a lack of reproducibility, whereas closed-loop simulation can face\ninsufficient realism or high computational costs. Open-loop evaluation, while\nbeing efficient and data-driven, relies on metrics that generally overlook\ncompounding errors. In this paper, we propose pseudo-simulation, a novel\nparadigm that addresses these limitations. Pseudo-simulation operates on real\ndatasets, similar to open-loop evaluation, but augments them with synthetic\nobservations generated prior to evaluation using 3D Gaussian Splatting. Our key\nidea is to approximate potential future states the AV might encounter by\ngenerating a diverse set of observations that vary in position, heading, and\nspeed. Our method then assigns a higher importance to synthetic observations\nthat best match the AV's likely behavior using a novel proximity-based\nweighting scheme. This enables evaluating error recovery and the mitigation of\ncausal confusion, as in closed-loop benchmarks, without requiring sequential\ninteractive simulation. We show that pseudo-simulation is better correlated\nwith closed-loop simulations (R^2=0.8) than the best existing open-loop\napproach (R^2=0.7). We also establish a public leaderboard for the community to\nbenchmark new methodologies with pseudo-simulation. Our code is available at\nhttps://github.com/autonomousvision/navsim.",

    "content": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities\nwhen trained with chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision. However, the long and\nverbose CoT traces, especially those distilled from large reasoning models\n(LRMs) such as DeepSeek-R1, significantly increase training costs during the\ndistillation process, where a non-reasoning base model is taught to replicate\nthe reasoning behavior of an LRM. In this work, we study the problem of CoT\ncondensation for resource-efficient reasoning training, aimed at pruning\nintermediate reasoning steps (i.e., thoughts) in CoT traces, enabling\nsupervised model training on length-reduced CoT data while preserving both\nanswer accuracy and the model's ability to generate coherent reasoning. Our\nrationale is that CoT traces typically follow a three-stage structure: problem\nunderstanding, exploration, and solution convergence. Through empirical\nanalysis, we find that retaining the structure of the reasoning trace,\nespecially the early stage of problem understanding (rich in reflective cues)\nand the final stage of solution convergence, is sufficient to achieve lossless\nreasoning supervision. To this end, we propose an Edge-Preserving Condensation\nmethod, EPiC, which selectively retains only the initial and final segments of\neach CoT trace while discarding the middle portion. This design draws an\nanalogy to preserving the \"edge\" of a reasoning trajectory, capturing both the\ninitial problem framing and the final answer synthesis, to maintain logical\ncontinuity. Experiments across multiple model families (Qwen and LLaMA) and\nbenchmarks show that EPiC reduces training time by over 34% while achieving\nlossless reasoning accuracy on MATH500, comparable to full CoT supervision. To\nthe best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore thought-level CoT\ncondensation for efficient reasoning model distillation.",

    "content": "Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (Dec-POMDPs) are\nknown to be NEXP-Complete and intractable to solve. However, for problems such\nas cooperative navigation, obstacle avoidance, and formation control, basic\nassumptions can be made about local visibility and local dependencies. The work\nDeWeese and Qu 2024 formalized these assumptions in the construction of the\nLocally Interdependent Multi-Agent MDP. In this setting, it establishes three\nclosed-form policies that are tractable to compute in various situations and\nare exponentially close to optimal with respect to visibility. However, it is\nalso shown that these solutions can have poor performance when the visibility\nis small and fixed, often getting stuck during simulations due to the so called\n\"Penalty Jittering\" phenomenon. In this work, we establish the Extended Cutoff\nPolicy Class which is, to the best of our knowledge, the first non-trivial\nclass of near optimal closed-form partially observable policies that are\nexponentially close to optimal with respect to the visibility for any Locally\nInterdependent Multi-Agent MDP. These policies are able to remember agents\nbeyond their visibilities which allows them to perform significantly better in\nmany small and fixed visibility settings, resolve Penalty Jittering\noccurrences, and under certain circumstances guarantee fully observable joint\noptimal behavior despite the partial observability. We also propose a\ngeneralized form of the Locally Interdependent Multi-Agent MDP that allows for\ntransition dependence and extended reward dependence, then replicate our\ntheoretical results in this setting.",

    "content": "Inspired by the remarkable reasoning capabilities of Deepseek-R1 in complex\ntextual tasks, many works attempt to incentivize similar capabilities in\nMultimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by directly applying reinforcement\nlearning (RL). However, they still struggle to activate complex reasoning. In\nthis paper, rather than examining multimodal RL in isolation, we delve into\ncurrent training pipelines and identify three crucial phenomena: 1) Effective\ncold start initialization is critical for enhancing MLLM reasoning.\nIntriguingly, we find that initializing with carefully selected text data alone\ncan lead to performance surpassing many recent multimodal reasoning models,\neven before multimodal RL. 2) Standard GRPO applied to multimodal RL suffers\nfrom gradient stagnation, which degrades training stability and performance. 3)\nSubsequent text-only RL training, following the multimodal RL phase, further\nenhances multimodal reasoning. This staged training approach effectively\nbalances perceptual grounding and cognitive reasoning development. By\nincorporating the above insights and addressing multimodal RL issues, we\nintroduce ReVisual-R1, achieving a new state-of-the-art among open-source 7B\nMLLMs on challenging benchmarks including MathVerse, MathVision, WeMath,\nLogicVista, DynaMath, and challenging AIME2024 and AIME2025.",

    "title": "Pseudo-Simulation for Autonomous Driving",
    "content": "Existing evaluation paradigms for Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) face critical\nlimitations. Real-world evaluation is often challenging due to safety concerns\nand a lack of reproducibility, whereas closed-loop simulation can face\ninsufficient realism or high computational costs. Open-loop evaluation, while\nbeing efficient and data-driven, relies on metrics that generally overlook\ncompounding errors. In this paper, we propose pseudo-simulation, a novel\nparadigm that addresses these limitations. Pseudo-simulation operates on real\ndatasets, similar to open-loop evaluation, but augments them with synthetic\nobservations generated prior to evaluation using 3D Gaussian Splatting. Our key\nidea is to approximate potential future states the AV might encounter by\ngenerating a diverse set of observations that vary in position, heading, and\nspeed. Our method then assigns a higher importance to synthetic observations\nthat best match the AV's likely behavior using a novel proximity-based\nweighting scheme. This enables evaluating error recovery and the mitigation of\ncausal confusion, as in closed-loop benchmarks, without requiring sequential\ninteractive simulation. We show that pseudo-simulation is better correlated\nwith closed-loop simulations (R^2=0.8) than the best existing open-loop\napproach (R^2=0.7). We also establish a public leaderboard for the community to\nbenchmark new methodologies with pseudo-simulation. Our code is available at\nhttps://github.com/autonomousvision/navsim.",

    "content": "Knowledge editing methods like MEMIT are able to make data and compute\nefficient updates of factual knowledge by using a single sentence to update\nfacts and their consequences. However, what is often overlooked is a\n\"precomputation step\", which requires a one-time but significant computational\ncost. The authors of MEMIT originally precompute approximately 44 million\nhidden vectors per edited layer, which requires a forward pass over 44 million\ntokens. For GPT-J (6B), this precomputation step takes 36 hours on a single\nGPU, while it takes approximately 40 hours for Llama2-7B. Additionally, this\nprecomputation time grows with model size. In this paper, we show that this\nexcessive computational cost is unnecessary. Knowledge editing using MEMIT and\nrelated methods, such as ROME and EMMET, can be performed by pre-computing a\nvery small portion of the 44 million hidden vectors. We first present the\ntheoretical minimum number of hidden vector precomputation required for\nsolutions of these editing methods to exist. We then empirically show that\nknowledge editing using these methods can be done by pre-computing\nsignificantly fewer hidden vectors. Specifically, we show that the\nprecomputation step can be done with less than 0.3% of the originally\nstipulated number of hidden vectors. This saves a significant amount of\nprecomputation time and allows users to begin editing new models within a few\nminutes.",

    "content": "Graphons, as limit objects of dense graph sequences, play a central role in\nthe statistical analysis of network data. However, existing graphon estimation\nmethods often struggle with scalability to large networks and\nresolution-independent approximation, due to their reliance on estimating\nlatent variables or costly metrics such as the Gromov-Wasserstein distance. In\nthis work, we propose a novel, scalable graphon estimator that directly\nrecovers the graphon via moment matching, leveraging implicit neural\nrepresentations (INRs). Our approach avoids latent variable modeling by\ntraining an INR--mapping coordinates to graphon values--to match empirical\nsubgraph counts (i.e., moments) from observed graphs. This direct estimation\nmechanism yields a polynomial-time solution and crucially sidesteps the\ncombinatorial complexity of Gromov-Wasserstein optimization. Building on\nfoundational results, we establish a theoretical guarantee: when the observed\nsubgraph motifs sufficiently represent those of the true graphon (a condition\nmet with sufficiently large or numerous graph samples), the estimated graphon\nachieves a provable upper bound in cut distance from the ground truth.\nAdditionally, we introduce MomentMixup, a data augmentation technique that\nperforms mixup in the moment space to enhance graphon-based learning. Our\ngraphon estimation method achieves strong empirical performance--demonstrating\nhigh accuracy on small graphs and superior computational efficiency on large\ngraphs--outperforming state-of-the-art scalable estimators in 75\\% of benchmark\nsettings and matching them in the remaining cases.

    "content": "Fine-grained and efficient controllability on video diffusion transformers\nhas raised increasing desires for the applicability. Recently, In-context\nConditioning emerged as a powerful paradigm for unified conditional video\ngeneration, which enables diverse controls by concatenating varying context\nconditioning signals with noisy video latents into a long unified token\nsequence and jointly processing them via full-attention, e.g., FullDiT. Despite\ntheir effectiveness, these methods face quadratic computation overhead as task\ncomplexity increases, hindering practical deployment. In this paper, we study\nthe efficiency bottleneck neglected in original in-context conditioning video\ngeneration framework. We begin with systematic analysis to identify two key\nsources of the computation inefficiencies: the inherent redundancy within\ncontext condition tokens and the computational redundancy in context-latent\ninteractions throughout the diffusion process. Based on these insights, we\npropose FullDiT2, an efficient in-context conditioning framework for general\ncontrollability in both video generation and editing tasks, which innovates\nfrom two key perspectives. Firstly, to address the token redundancy, FullDiT2\nleverages a dynamic token selection mechanism to adaptively identify important\ncontext tokens, reducing the sequence length for unified full-attention.\nAdditionally, a selective context caching mechanism is devised to minimize\nredundant interactions between condition tokens and video latents. Extensive\nexperiments on six diverse conditional video editing and generation tasks\ndemonstrate that FullDiT2 achieves significant computation reduction and 2-3\ntimes speedup in averaged time cost per diffusion step, with minimal\ndegradation or even higher performance in video generation quality.

Experiments show that our method\nreduces 3D motion estimation error by over 50% compared to the latest method,\nachieve 55% average success rate in diverse tasks where prior approaches\nfail~($\\lesssim 10$\\%), and can even acquire fine-grained manipulation skills\nlike insertion.",

    "content": "Inspired by the remarkable reasoning capabilities of Deepseek-R1 in complex\ntextual tasks, many works attempt to incentivize similar capabilities in\nMultimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by directly applying reinforcement\nlearning (RL). However, they still struggle to activate complex reasoning. In\nthis paper, rather than examining multimodal RL in isolation, we delve into\ncurrent training pipelines and identify three crucial phenomena: 1) Effective\ncold start initialization is critical for enhancing MLLM reasoning.\nIntriguingly, we find that initializing with carefully selected text data alone\ncan lead to performance surpassing many recent multimodal reasoning models,\neven before multimodal RL. 2) Standard GRPO applied to multimodal RL suffers\nfrom gradient stagnation, which degrades training stability and performance. 3)\nSubsequent text-only RL training, following the multimodal RL phase, further\nenhances multimodal reasoning. This staged training approach effectively\nbalances perceptual grounding and cognitive reasoning development. By\nincorporating the above insights and addressing multimodal RL issues, we\nintroduce ReVisual-R1, achieving a new state-of-the-art among open-source 7B\nMLLMs on challenging benchmarks including MathVerse, MathVision, WeMath,\nLogicVista, DynaMath, and challenging AIME2024 and AIME2025.",

    "title": "Efficient Knowledge Editing via Minimal Precomputation",
    "content": "Knowledge editing methods like MEMIT are able to make data and compute\nefficient updates of factual knowledge by using a single sentence to update\nfacts and their consequences. However, what is often overlooked is a\n\"precomputation step\", which requires a one-time but significant computational\ncost. The authors of MEMIT originally precompute approximately 44 million\nhidden vectors per edited layer, which requires a forward pass over 44 million\ntokens. For GPT-J (6B), this precomputation step takes 36 hours on a single\nGPU, while it takes approximately 40 hours for Llama2-7B. Additionally, this\nprecomputation time grows with model size. In this paper, we show that this\nexcessive computational cost is unnecessary. Knowledge editing using MEMIT and\nrelated methods, such as ROME and EMMET, can be performed by pre-computing a\nvery small portion of the 44 million hidden vectors. We first present the\ntheoretical minimum number of hidden vector precomputation required for\nsolutions of these editing methods to exist. We then empirically show that\nknowledge editing using these methods can be done by pre-computing\nsignificantly fewer hidden vectors. Specifically, we show that the\nprecomputation step can be done with less than 0.3% of the originally\nstipulated number of hidden vectors. This saves a significant amount of\nprecomputation time and allows users to begin editing new models within a few\nminutes.",

    "content": "Geometry optimization of atomic structures is a common and crucial task in\ncomputational chemistry and materials design. Following the learning to\noptimize paradigm, we propose a new multi-agent reinforcement learning method\ncalled Multi-Agent Crystal Structure optimization (MACS) to address periodic\ncrystal structure optimization. MACS treats geometry optimization as a\npartially observable Markov game in which atoms are agents that adjust their\npositions to collectively discover a stable configuration. We train MACS across\nvarious compositions of reported crystalline materials to obtain a policy that\nsuccessfully optimizes structures from the training compositions as well as\nstructures of larger sizes and unseen compositions, confirming its excellent\nscalability and zero-shot transferability. We benchmark our approach against a\nbroad range of state-of-the-art optimization methods and demonstrate that MACS\noptimizes periodic crystal structures significantly faster, with fewer energy\ncalculations, and the lowest failure rate.",

    "content": "Long context large language models (LLMs) are deployed in many real-world\napplications such as RAG, agent, and broad LLM-integrated applications. Given\nan instruction and a long context (e.g., documents, PDF files, webpages), a\nlong context LLM can generate an output grounded in the provided context,\naiming to provide more accurate, up-to-date, and verifiable outputs while\nreducing hallucinations and unsupported claims. This raises a research\nquestion: how to pinpoint the texts (e.g., sentences, passages, or paragraphs)\nin the context that contribute most to or are responsible for the generated\noutput by an LLM? This process, which we call context traceback, has various\nreal-world applications, such as 1) debugging LLM-based systems, 2) conducting\npost-attack forensic analysis for attacks (e.g., prompt injection attack,\nknowledge corruption attacks) to an LLM, and 3) highlighting knowledge sources\nto enhance the trust of users towards outputs generated by LLMs. When applied\nto context traceback for long context LLMs, existing feature attribution\nmethods such as Shapley have sub-optimal performance and/or incur a large\ncomputational cost. In this work, we develop TracLLM, the first generic context\ntraceback framework tailored to long context LLMs. Our framework can improve\nthe effectiveness and efficiency of existing feature attribution methods. To\nimprove the efficiency, we develop an informed search based algorithm in\nTracLLM. We also develop contribution score ensemble/denoising techniques to\nimprove the accuracy of TracLLM. Our evaluation results show TracLLM can\neffectively identify texts in a long context that lead to the output of an LLM.\nOur code and data are at: https://github.com/Wang-Yanting/TracLLM.",

    "content": "The rapid progress of navigation, manipulation, and vision models has made\nmobile manipulators capable in many specialized tasks. However, the open-world\nmobile manipulation (OWMM) task remains a challenge due to the need for\ngeneralization to open-ended instructions and environments, as well as the\nsystematic complexity to integrate high-level decision making with low-level\nrobot control based on both global scene understanding and current agent state.\nTo address this complexity, we propose a novel multi-modal agent architecture\nthat maintains multi-view scene frames and agent states for decision-making and\ncontrols the robot by function calling. A second challenge is the hallucination\nfrom domain shift. To enhance the agent performance, we further introduce an\nagentic data synthesis pipeline for the OWMM task to adapt the VLM model to our\ntask domain with instruction fine-tuning. We highlight our fine-tuned OWMM-VLM\nas the first dedicated foundation model for mobile manipulators with global\nscene understanding, robot state tracking, and multi-modal action generation in\na unified model. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our model achieves\nSOTA performance compared to other foundation models including GPT-4o and\nstrong zero-shot generalization in real world.

    "content": "Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (Dec-POMDPs) are\nknown to be NEXP-Complete and intractable to solve. However, for problems such\nas cooperative navigation, obstacle avoidance, and formation control, basic\nassumptions can be made about local visibility and local dependencies. The work\nDeWeese and Qu 2024 formalized these assumptions in the construction of the\nLocally Interdependent Multi-Agent MDP. In this setting, it establishes three\nclosed-form policies that are tractable to compute in various situations and\nare exponentially close to optimal with respect to visibility. However, it is\nalso shown that these solutions can have poor performance when the visibility\nis small and fixed, often getting stuck during simulations due to the so called\n\"Penalty Jittering\" phenomenon. In this work, we establish the Extended Cutoff\nPolicy Class which is, to the best of our knowledge, the first non-trivial\nclass of near optimal closed-form partially observable policies that are\nexponentially close to optimal with respect to the visibility for any Locally\nInterdependent Multi-Agent MDP. These policies are able to remember agents\nbeyond their visibilities which allows them to perform significantly better in\nmany small and fixed visibility settings, resolve Penalty Jittering\noccurrences, and under certain circumstances guarantee fully observable joint\noptimal behavior despite the partial observability. We also propose a\ngeneralized form of the Locally Interdependent Multi-Agent MDP that allows for\ntransition dependence and extended reward dependence, then replicate our\ntheoretical results in this setting.",

    "content": "Recent trends in test-time scaling for reasoning models (e.g., OpenAI o1,\nDeepSeek R1) have led to a popular belief that extending thinking traces using\nprompts like \"Wait\" or \"Let me rethink\" can improve performance. This raises a\nnatural question: Does thinking more at test-time truly lead to better\nreasoning? To answer this question, we perform a detailed empirical study\nacross models and benchmarks, which reveals a consistent pattern of initial\nperformance improvements from additional thinking followed by a decline, due to\n\"overthinking\". To understand this non-monotonic trend, we consider a simple\nprobabilistic model, which reveals that additional thinking increases output\nvariance-creating an illusion of improved reasoning while ultimately\nundermining precision. Thus, observed gains from \"more thinking\" are not true\nindicators of improved reasoning, but artifacts stemming from the connection\nbetween model uncertainty and evaluation metric. This suggests that test-time\nscaling through extended thinking is not an effective way to utilize the\ninference thinking budget. Recognizing these limitations, we introduce an\nalternative test-time scaling approach, parallel thinking, inspired by\nBest-of-N sampling.

    "content": "Existing evaluation paradigms for Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) face critical\nlimitations. Real-world evaluation is often challenging due to safety concerns\nand a lack of reproducibility, whereas closed-loop simulation can face\ninsufficient realism or high computational costs. Open-loop evaluation, while\nbeing efficient and data-driven, relies on metrics that generally overlook\ncompounding errors. In this paper, we propose pseudo-simulation, a novel\nparadigm that addresses these limitations. Pseudo-simulation operates on real\ndatasets, similar to open-loop evaluation, but augments them with synthetic\nobservations generated prior to evaluation using 3D Gaussian Splatting. Our key\nidea is to approximate potential future states the AV might encounter by\ngenerating a diverse set of observations that vary in position, heading, and\nspeed. Our method then assigns a higher importance to synthetic observations\nthat best match the AV's likely behavior using a novel proximity-based\nweighting scheme. This enables evaluating error recovery and the mitigation of\ncausal confusion, as in closed-loop benchmarks, without requiring sequential\ninteractive simulation. We show that pseudo-simulation is better correlated\nwith closed-loop simulations (R^2=0.8) than the best existing open-loop\napproach (R^2=0.7).

Previous methods often rely on task-specific\narchitectures (e.g., additional adapter modules) or dedicated customizations\n(e.g., DDIM inversion), which limit the integration of versatile editing\nconditions and the unification of various editing tasks. In this paper, we\nintroduce UNified In-Context Video Editing (UNIC), a simple yet effective\nframework that unifies diverse video editing tasks within a single model in an\nin-context manner. To achieve this unification, we represent the inputs of\nvarious video editing tasks as three types of tokens: the source video tokens,\nthe noisy video latent, and the multi-modal conditioning tokens that vary\naccording to the specific editing task. Based on this formulation, our key\ninsight is to integrate these three types into a single consecutive token\nsequence and jointly model them using the native attention operations of DiT,\nthereby eliminating the need for task-specific adapter designs. Nevertheless,\ndirect task unification under this framework is challenging, leading to severe\ntoken collisions and task confusion due to the varying video lengths and\ndiverse condition modalities across tasks. To address these, we introduce\ntask-aware RoPE to facilitate consistent temporal positional encoding, and\ncondition bias that enables the model to clearly differentiate different\nediting tasks. This allows our approach to adaptively perform different video\nediting tasks by referring the source video and varying condition tokens \"in\ncontext\", and support flexible task composition. To validate our method, we\nconstruct a unified video editing benchmark containing six representative video\nediting tasks. Results demonstrate that our unified approach achieves superior\nperformance on each task and exhibits emergent task composition abilities.",

This suggests that test-time\nscaling through extended thinking is not an effective way to utilize the\ninference thinking budget. Recognizing these limitations, we introduce an\nalternative test-time scaling approach, parallel thinking, inspired by\nBest-of-N sampling. Our method generates multiple independent reasoning paths\nwithin the same inference budget and selects the most consistent response via\nmajority vote, achieving up to 20% higher accuracy compared to extended\nthinking. This provides a simple yet effective mechanism for test-time scaling\nof reasoning models.",

    "title": "TracLLM: A Generic Framework for Attributing Long Context LLMs",
    "content": "Long context large language models (LLMs) are deployed in many real-world\napplications such as RAG, agent, and broad LLM-integrated applications. Given\nan instruction and a long context (e.g., documents, PDF files, webpages), a\nlong context LLM can generate an output grounded in the provided context,\naiming to provide more accurate, up-to-date, and verifiable outputs while\nreducing hallucinations and unsupported claims. This raises a research\nquestion: how to pinpoint the texts (e.g., sentences, passages, or paragraphs)\nin the context that contribute most to or are responsible for the generated\noutput by an LLM? This process, which we call context traceback, has various\nreal-world applications, such as 1) debugging LLM-based systems, 2) conducting\npost-attack forensic analysis for attacks (e.g., prompt injection attack,\nknowledge corruption attacks) to an LLM, and 3) highlighting knowledge sources\nto enhance the trust of users towards outputs generated by LLMs. When applied\nto context traceback for long context LLMs, existing feature attribution\nmethods such as Shapley have sub-optimal performance and/or incur a large\ncomputational cost. In this work, we develop TracLLM, the first generic context\ntraceback framework tailored to long context LLMs. Our framework can improve\nthe effectiveness and efficiency of existing feature attribution methods. To\nimprove the efficiency, we develop an informed search based algorithm in\nTracLLM. We also develop contribution score ensemble/denoising techniques to\nimprove the accuracy of TracLLM. Our evaluation results show TracLLM can\neffectively identify texts in a long context that lead to the output of an LLM.\nOur code and data are at: https://github.com/Wang-Yanting/TracLLM.",
