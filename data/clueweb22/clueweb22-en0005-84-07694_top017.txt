Question:
will these work on slim cigarettes
Answer:
Currently our standard mini filter design does not hold a "slim" cigarette tightly
However starting in January our new product Airio a "micro" filter design will be available
It is made to work with regular and slim cigarette. Look for it in stores and on amazon in the beginning of next year.

Question:
have a lot of people quit smoking by using this product?
Answer:
I have not used Nic-Out to quit smoking, use the product to cut down on the  harmful chemicals in cigarettes. But I am sure it can be used to quit, as my cravings are much less, then when I did not use Nic-Out.

how many cigarettes for one Nic out filter
Answer:
Really varies, The supplier says average of 3 to 5 cigarettes per filter, but this can vary from smoker and what cigarettes being used as some cigarettes have more tar than others. Thanks
