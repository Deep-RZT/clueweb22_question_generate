Compact & Convenient - No cleaning or maintenance required. Simply toss in the trash when no longer effective.
Perfect Fit - with Your Favorite Brand - Fits all standard-sized cigarettes. To use with slims, just add TarGard’s Slim Cigarette Adapter (sold separately).
Effective - Watch each filter work, and know when it's time to toss away and replace with a fresh new one.

PREFERRED BY AN ORIGINAL
Years after his untimely death, Hunter S. Thompson remains a cultural icon to millions all over the world. He was a true original... and the world’s most famous TarGard fan.
A lifelong smoker, Hunter was rarely photographed without his trusty TarGard Permanent Filter System in hand. A true believer and brand advocate, he often sang the praises of his simple, affordable “TarGards” to smokers he met during his adventures.
As we close in on 20 years since Hunter’s passing, we miss his tales, his unique perspectives, and his Gonzo spirit more than ever. But we know he’s still out there somewhere wandering the universe, a “fly in the soup”, with a big grin on his face and a TarGard clenched between his teeth. RIP, HST.

can i use it for dokha
This disposable filter is used for any regular size cigarettes that hold tar & nicotine suppose to go my lung and help to protect me from any possible lung cancer.  I am unsure whether you can use that for dokha. I've never tried it yet.

This is Kristina from TarGard. It is hard to say how much is filtered out while using TarGard cigarette filters since the percent captured depends on the individual user. If you have any more questions, please contact me directly.  Kristina - Marketplace Customer Care
