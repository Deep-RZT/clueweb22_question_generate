Telescope
1.
    What is a telescope? 
• We can say that a telescope is an instrument that is used to view distant 
objects. If you want to look at the planets, you can use a telescope. The 
higher the magnification on the telescope, the better your view will be. 
But a scientific definition of the word telescope is an instrument that aids 
in the observation of remote objects by collecting electromagnetic 
radiation (such as visible light). They found use in terrestrial applications 
and astronomy.
2. Parts of a telescope 
A telescope consists of 26 pieces: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZoEKIYV8BI
3. Inventor of the telescope 
• Hans Lippershey (1570 – September 1619), also known as Johann Lippershey or Lipperhey, 
was a German dutch spectacle-maker. He is commonly associated with the invention of 
the telescope, although it is unclear if he was the first to build one. 
• Lippershey applied to the States General of the Netherlands on October 2, 1608, for a patent 
for his instrument "for seeing things far away as if they were nearby", beating another Dutch 
instrument-maker's patent, Jacob Metius, by a few weeks. Lippershey failed to receive a 
patent since the same claim for invention had also been made by other spectacle-makers but 
he was handsomely rewarded by the Dutch government for copies of his design.
4. Evolution 
• The 1600s 
1608:Hans Lippershey, a German-Dutch lensmaker 
once said that he wanted to make an instrument 
“for seeing things far away as they were nearby.” 
He was the first person to ever think of the telescope. 
1609:On hearing about this new instrument, Italian physicist Galileo Galilei builds his own. 
He improved Lippershey’s design and using his new telescope the following year, 
he discovers the four largest moons of Jupiter (Io, Ganymede, Callisto and Europa), 
sunspots on the surface of the Sun, the phases of Venus and physical features on 
the Moon - such as craters!
5. 1616: Italian priest and astronomer Niccolo Zucchi creates a concave spherical mirror (a mirror that bulges 
inwards) to magnify objects and he used it to discover Jupiter’s belts 14 years later. 
1630:German priest and astronomer Christoph Scheiner builds a telescope based on a design that astronomer 
Johannes Kepler made in 1611. Kepler’s design improves on Galileo’s by replacing the concave lens with a 
convex lens (a lens that bulges outwards). This helped to reduce spherical aberration. Astronomers find 
spherical aberration quite annoying as it means that they do not get perfect images when they look 
through their telescopes. Imagine having distorted vision! 
1650: Inspired by the observations of Jupiter made by Galileo, 
Dutch astronomer Christian Huygens builds the most powerful 
telescope ever and uses it to view the planets in our Solar System. 
He spotted a bright moon in orbit around Saturn and called it “Saturni Luna.” 
All astronomers used this name until 1847 when John Herschel (famous astronomer 
William Herschel’s son) decided that the moon should be called Titan. 
Huygens studied Saturn much more with his telescope and discovered 
the true shape of the planet’s rings in 1659. 
1666: After studying the reflection of light through prisms, Sir Isaac Newton decides that the problem of 
chromatic aberration cannot be solved. He makes an improved version of the reflecting telescope. 
1673:Laurent Cassegrain, a catholic priest from France, develops a telescope that bears his name - the 
Cassegrain telescope. This instrument uses mirrors that are called hyperbolic and parabolic mirrors.
6. • The 1700s 
1721: English mathematician (and inventor of the octant) John Hadley present a much-improved Newtonian 
telescope design. 
1729: A huge development in refracting telescope happens during this time when lawyer Chester Moore Hall 
makes a lens to reduce chromatic aberration even further. He made the lens by cementing two types of 
glass (crown and flint) together. He proved that Newton’s statement that chromatic aberration could not 
be solved was incorrect! 
1789: Bath (UK) Orchestra Director and astronomer 
William Herschel builds a Newtonian based reflector 
telescope which is a gigantic 12-metres. It was the first 
of the giant reflector telescopes. 
· The 1800s 
1845:“Leviathan of Parsonstown” at Birr Castle in Ireland 
was built in this year by the Third Earl of Rosse, William Parsons. 
It was the largest telescope ever built until the twentieth century. 
Parsons was the first person to see spiral arms on a galaxy! 
1897:American astronomer Alvan Clark builds the world’s largest 
(at that time!) existing refracting telescope - the Yerkes Telescope 
in Wisconsin. Because this telescope holds the largest glass lens possible 
before a telescope will begin to buckle under its own weight, astronomers 
decided that large telescopes should have mirrors instead of lenses.
7. • The 1900s 
1937: Inspired by sky survey work by Karl Jansky, American engineer Grote Reber takes the telescope into a 
whole new dimension: the radio telescope. Reber created an instrument that could basically see radio 
waves - waves that are invisible to our eyes. 
1957:Astronomer Sir Bernard Lovell planned a 250ft radio telescope 
that could be pointed to anywhere in the sky in the 1950s. After a series 
of technical and financial problems, it was finally built and ready to be used 
in the summer of 1957. The telescope can be visited at Jodrell Bank in the UK. 
1990:NASA and ESA’s Hubble Space Telescope, the first telescope to be launched into space. Above the 
turbulence of the Earth’s atmosphere, Hubble gives us a very clear view of the stars and planets right to this 
very day! 
1991: The Compton Gamma Ray Observatory becomes the first space telescope to look at objects that belch 
out high energy waves called gamma rays. 
1995:The W. M. Keck Observatory, a two-telescope astronomical 
observatory, is built near the summit of Mauna Kea in Hawaii at an 
incredibly dizzy height of 13,600 feet. They are the second largest optical 
telescopes in the world.
