Description
Description:
The new 1-mile range Matrix 50.5X Responder SST System from Clifford is the most advanced 2-Way Security and Remote Start system in the world! The new Matrix 50.5X employs Spread Spectrum Technology, digital frequency hopping and multiple frequency transmission to assure that even if a frequency is blocked, the signal still will go through. The Responder SST also has dual error correction systems to combat signal data corruption and minimize any signal interference. The end result is an amazing range of up to one full mile!
The interactive display on the Responder 2-way remote confirms all commands (almost instantly) with simple to comprehend icons and text. The remote alerts users to security system triggers by beeping or vibrating when out of audible range of the siren. The Matrix 50.5X will also start your vehicle with the push of a button (when remote start is installed), and you'll get confirmation back that the vehicle has been started.
