G5 ACCESSORIES
State-of-the-Art Clifford Accessories are G5 Compatible! Great
news about G5 - Clifford has engineered the next generation
of technological innovation in vehicle security to be backwards
compatible. The core of G5 is CliffNet  , the revolutionary digital
link between every Clifford component and major accessory. With
CliffNet, each piece in the system is "daisychained" together to offer
the highest degree of sophistication, compatibility and reliability, so you
can add the following accessories to your G5 system to create the
ultimate in security, luxury and convenience.
SmartWindows TM
(p/n 903010)
More Power to Power Windows. Open, close and vent the car's power
windows using the G5 security system remote control. SmartWindows
also adds extra features inside the vehicle: one tap fully open, one tap
fully closed. Tap the switch during roll-up and roll-down to instantly
stop the window. Vent opening is selectable via the CliffNet Wizard,
and can be vented repeatedly after remote arming. The SmartWindows
Safety Stop feature halts window movement if there is an obstruction.
Garage Door Interface TM
(p/n 519H2)
An Open and Shut Case. The G5-compatible Garage Door Interface
offers 66-bit ACG2 anti-code grabbing technology to protect your
garage and home from thieves' electronic cloning devices. Controls
garage doors and /or entry gate openers using the Clifford G5 system
remote control. Installs in minutes with just a screwdriver.
BlackJax TM
5 (p/n 909505)
Carjacking Response & Vehicle Recovery System. BlackJax is
Clifford's unique anti-carjacking response system that puts personal
safety first while using innovative advancements to ensure that users
can recover the vehicle themselves. If an armed car thief approaches
- whether at a stop light or in a parking lot (where most carjackings
occur) - immediately turn over the keys and remote and let Clifford
technology take over.
Fully automatic: No buttons or transmitters to push when a gun is
involved. Just get away from the vehicle. Quick response: BlackJax
allows the criminal to drive away a safe distance. Then, a few
seconds later, BlackJax blares the siren and flashes the lights to
alert other drivers and witnesses. It then pulses down the ignition
system to safely force the vehicle to slow to a complete stop. Siren
blaring and lights flashing, unable to restart the engine, the carjacker
has no choice but to ab and on the vehicle.
Immediate vehicle self-recovery: With the vehicle immobilized a
short distance away, the owner can recover it. No special tracking
units, monthly fees or per-use charges. Just follow the sound of the
BlackJax siren, then enter the PIN code. That's it - it's sabotageproof.
The only way to turn off BlackJax is with a secret userselectable
PIN code. If the carjacker tries guessing codes at r and om,
BlackJax actively ignores his code entries for the next few minutes.
Even if he were to find and remove the BlackJax control unit, he
would still be unable to restart the engine. That's Clifford technology
you can count on.

The innovation and technology that makes these systems so intimidating to thieves is also
what makes them so convenient for users. Access up to 16 functions with the press of a
button on the remote for literally instant comm and of an awesome array of security and
lifestyle-enhancing features, including remote engine start, remote control trunk release,
headlight automation and window auto close.* G5 from Clifford is quite simply the state
of the art.
High-Tech Sensors
Extra Sensory Protection. Clifford's ground breaking thinking has also gone into
making the ultimate smart sensing technology enhancements.
Digital Tilt Motion Sensor (p/n 507M)
Detects even minor lifting or rolling of the vehicle without any of the false alarms
common to all other tilt and motion sensors. Advanced design allows maximum
stability in extreme conditions. Motion can be turned off for tilt only sensing. A
must for vehicles with upgraded wheels and tires. Automatically self-adjusting
Digital Dual Zone Proximity Sensor p/n 905311
This digital signal processing (DSP) radar sensor's outer perimeter warning
zone provides an invisible shield up to a foot outside the closed windows and
convertible top. The interior zone instantly blasts the full alarm if someone leans
into the passenger compartment. Especially recommended for convertibles and
other soft-sided or open vehicles.
Glass Tamper Sensor p/n 506T
Glass Tamper Sensor identifies the sound of glass breaking attempts, and
differentiates them from common noises that false alarm other glass sensors. The
G5 Glass Tamper Sensor even detects glass punch devices that quietly shatter
windows without impact or vibration.
Ultrasonic Sensor (p/n 509U)
The 509U Ultrasonic Sensor is used to provide coverage of a vehicle’s interior
cabin area. The sensor detects movement inside the vehicle by sensing air
disturbance.They should trigger the alarm if a thief has gained access to the
interior of your vehicle.
Smart Self-Powered Siren (p/n 515C)
Thieves' Worst Enemy. The world's most advanced and dependable siren for G5
systems. Its built-in battery allows this siren to keep on wailing even if the wires
are cut! And its G5 Digital ComLink will detect wire tampering that thieves use to
bypass other battery-backed sirens. Its smart charging system won't drain your
car battery like other sirens of this type. It will even warn you if the internal battery
charge is very low. No override keys are needed like other such sirens. Provides
Personalized Siren Sounds even on Clifford G5 security systems lacking that
feature (selecting from among 15 different sounds via CliffNet Wizard.)
* Additional parts and labor may be required.
