In the 36 years since my parents said "I do" on this day, they've lived on nearly every continent, forged incredible careers, stayed strong through countless deployments, rebuilt a post-military ‚Äúretirement‚Äù life together and...oh yeah... created three (pretty awesome, if I do say so myself) humans- all while adding a son-in-law this year! I hold their marriage as an inspiration for my own and wish them 36 more fun-filled, spontaneous years of wedded bliss.
#HappyAnniversary,  you two!
