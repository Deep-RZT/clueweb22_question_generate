Denicotea - Pipedia
Denicotea
Willy Heineberg founded the company Denicotea in 1932 and began manufacturing and selling smoking accessories such as filters, filter inserts, cigarette holders and pipes. [1] The company headquarters was initially in Cologne, but was relocated to Bergisch Gladbach after the Second World War. [2]
Denicotea is actually the name of a silica gel filter, cigarette holders and care products for pipes and cigarette holders.
I still find it a bit confusing as Denicotea seems to be a company [3] and a brand as well which is operated by COMPOSING-STUDIO GmbH [4] .

Depending on the different lines the pipes are made by Cesare Barontini, Gigi or Molina Pipe for Denicotea GmbH .

Stefan Petzuch points out this brand appears to have similarities to the Mauro Cateni pipe brand, in particular they are both fictional Italian brands by German companies, and both have the "HAND CUT" imprint on the stem as seen bellow. This may connect the Aldo Morelli brand to Gebr. Heinemann KG in Hamburg, who had registered the Mauro Cateni brand. Or perhaps there is a connection between Denicotea and Gegr. Heinemann KG, or perhaps these pipe brands simply used "Hand Cut" stems from the same source.
