It's absolutely worth the price NO regrets

Okay, I originally started looking at this alarm back in August 18, however it became unavailable on Amazon for several months and so I forgot about it.  I previously had a remote start system that seemed like it would usually  only  start  the  vehicle  when  I was very close  to it.  The purported range of this Clifford is what got me interested in it.  On Thanksgiving day of 2018 I just happened to check Amazon and there was one Clifford 5906x remaining.  I immediately  ordered it and if there is one of two complaints, the first would be that since it was not offered on prime I had to wait a little bit longer for it to arrive.  It was well worth the wait however.  I really like this system and the remote starts range is unbelievable.  Example, I parked the truck way, way out "where nobody prefers to park" in the front parking lot of a Wal Mart supercenter.  From all the way in the back  of the  supercenter this Clifford remote will still start the truck "amazing".  My previous remote start at Wal Mart  only worked when I was right by the vehicle.  It's only been about a month that I've had this system ...oh my second complaint is I have accidentally activated the remote start on two occasions and so I'd say that they should have made a bit harder to start the vehicle with the remote, such as maybe requiring you to hold down the button or something like that to prevent this.  Nevertheless  I still give this 5 full stars an I would buy it for, or move this one to my next GM.  It is well worth its price and I have no regrets. Update:: I read the instructions further and I figured out how to lock the buttons on the remote so that it requires a 2 button series of presses to unlock it.  This will avoid any future unintentional remote starts to the vehicle. I am very satisfied with this purchase.

It works great with other directed accessories such as the bluetooth module ...

This alarm system comes as a kit and needs to be installed either by yourself or have a professional install it. It comes with everything you need to wire up to your car. From the hood switch, to the alarm horn, ecu of course, 2 remotes, antenna,  and a simple wire diagram of the unit. It works great with other directed accessories such as the bluetooth module to control the alarm with your smartphone. One thing you need to be aware of is if your car has a immobilizer system. If so, you will be needing a bypass unit which is not included. So far every feature on this kit is working properly as described. Very happy with the final results of the alarm system.

Just had it installed. It is as I expected. High quality from Clifford. One note though, this alarm requires extra equipment depending on the make of your vehicle so there will be extra costs on top of buying the alarm.

I think this is one of the best car alarms on the market. very nice features on the remote. Just to let you know. If you have trouble with the cargo starting feature you might have to switch it from The Manual Transmission mode to the Automatic Transmission mode. Mine was on the Manual mode.

Can't go wrong with the top of the line alarm from DEI.I have always preferred teh clifford over the viper, but they asside from the remotes, they are litterally the same thing. The range from the transmitter to the vehicle is my favorite part.
