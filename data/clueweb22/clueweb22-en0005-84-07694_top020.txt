Question:
Reduces tar by 90% but how much nicotine do they reduce? It's the nicotine that is addictive???
Answer:
Correct. It doesn't reduce nicotine. But it reduces alot of the tar that saturates your lungs.

Question:
how many packs for $17.86
Answer:
You should receive 200 filters total.   That’s 2 packs, each with one hundred filters.   I usually use one filter for 4 cigarettes.  That’s five filters per pack of cigarettes or 50 filters per carton.

what percent of nicotine do they remove, I don't care about tar right now????
I've been using Magic 25 for 7 years. It doesn't remove any nicotine but I cannot smoke without them. It cuts the tar down tremendously.
