Product Description
One filter for 6 - 7 cigaretts This product will not repair damage to the lungs..It has been proven that with the constant use of the TARBAR filters ,much of the harmfull substances will REMAIN in the FILTER and not enter your LUNGS. SCIENCE.....With inhalation the smoke is fed into the filter and forced through the 6 pinpoint holes creating a circular motion with wind speeds in excess of 200 mph. The centrifugal force pushes much of the impurities to the sides of the filter preventing them from entering your lungs.

Question:
Why do about a third of the product crack or break in half before the 3rd use now?
Answer:
I never had that problem? Maybe your Cigs are fatter than normal? The problem I have are 25% are clogged from the get-go. Still worth the hassle. Because it cartches most the Tar, before it gets to lungs.

Will these fit roll your own cigarette tubes like gambler tube cut or zen?
Answer:
I've been using these Tar Bars for a couple of years on home-rolled cigarettes made on a little Gambler machine with Golden Harvest tubes & they fit perfectly. I think all tubes have the same diameter filter. Never had a problem.
