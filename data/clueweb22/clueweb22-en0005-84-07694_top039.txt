Product Description
EFFICIENT PREMIUM CIGARETTE FILTERS, HIGH QUALITY!
8 HOLE FILTRATION SYSTEM
Efficient filters help reduce the tar by up to 90% and many smokers love it because the taste of the cigarette does not change! Clear part of Efficient filters are made out of high quality Crystal which is called Polystyrene.  Yellow filter inside is made out of polypropylene.
These materials are 100% safe and have no negative effect on human health.
Each Efficient filter can be used up to 6 times
It will immediately be visible how much tar is trapped in the yellow filter, as the filter turns darker and darker after each smoke.
STEP 1
I nsert your cigarette into t he filter. The filters will fit on your major cigarette brand and are sized to fit r egular cigarettes only and will not fit "slim" cigarettes.
STEP 2
The filter traps most of the tar in cigarette smoke without compromising the flavor of your cigarettes.
RESULT
Each filter is good for 3-6 cigarettes.  Use it to get rid of nicotine stains on your fingers as well as to regain the natural color of your teeth and most importantly reduce hazard intake to your lungs.
About Efficient Filters
EFFICIENT Cigarette Filters and Holders manufacturing facilities are located in Europe (Turkey) and are produced with the highest quality materials and workmanship.

Do you find yourself smoking "more" cigarettes when using these filters?
No, actually for me it's been much less, & I cannot do it without the filter now.  I give away filters to family, friends & strangers to try to encourage the use of these filters.

How many holes is this? 4? 6? 8?
Answer:
Not sure how many holes, but I can tell you that they smoke smooth and have a nice draw. Not a lot of air if that's what you mean. I don't like smoking without them. Buy them

How do you know when the filter is "filled up" and time to start a new one?  After 1 cigarette, there is a lot of brown sludge in there.
Answer:
It all depends on the brand of cigarette you are smoking...some have more tar than others...I use 1 filter for every 2 cigarettes, that's why I always buy the 300 pack. At the local tobacco place, they sell 30 filters for about $3.50.
