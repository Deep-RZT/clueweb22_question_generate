The Telescope
The telescope was one of the central instruments of 
        what has been called the Scientific Revolution of the seventeenth century. 
        It revealed hitherto unsuspected phenomena in the heavens and had a profound 
        influence on the controversy between followers of the traditional geocentric 
        astronomy and cosmology and those who favored the heliocentric system of Copernicus. It 
        was the first extension of one of man's senses, and demonstrated that 
        ordinary observers could see things that the great Aristotle had not dreamed 
        of. It therefore helped shift authority in the observation of nature from 
        men to instruments. In short, it was the prototype of modern scientific 
        instruments. But the telescope was not the invention of scientists; rather, 
        it was the product of craftsmen. For that reason, much of its origin is 
        inaccessible to us since craftsmen were by and large illiterate and therefore 
        historically often invisible.
Although the magnifying and diminishing properties 
        of convex and concave transparent objects was known in Antiquity, lenses 
        as we know them were introduced in the West [1] at the 
        end of the thirteenth century. Glass of reasonable quality had become 
        relatively cheap and in the major glass-making centers of Venice and Florence 
        techniques for grinding and polishing glass had reached a high state of 
        development. Now one of the perennial problems faced by aging scholars 
        could be solved. With age, the eye progressively loses its power to accommodate, 
        that is to change its focus from faraway objects to nearby ones. This 
        condition, known as presbyopia, becomes noticeable for most people 
        in their forties, when they can no longer focus on letters held at a comfortable 
        distance from the eye. Magnifying glasses became common in the thirteenth 
        century, but these are cumbersome, especially when one is writing. Craftsmen 
        in Venice began making small disks of glass, convex on both sides, that 
        could be worn in a frame--spectacles. Because these little disks were 
        shaped like lentils, they became known as "lentils of glass," or (from 
        the Latin) lenses. The earliest illustrations of spectacles date 
        from about 1350, and spectacles soon came to be symbols of learning.

These spectacles were, then, reading glasses. When 
        one had trouble reading, one went to a spectacle-maker's shop or a peddler 
        of spectacles (see figs. 2 and 3) and found a suitable pair by trial and 
        error. They were, by and large, glasses for the old. spectacles for the 
        young, concave lenses [2] that correct the refractive error known as myopia, were first made (again in Italy) in the middle of the fifteenth century. 
        So by about 1450 the ingredients for making a telescope were there. The 
        telescopic effect can be achieved by several combinations of concave and 
        convex mirrors and lenses. Why was the telescope not invented in the fifteenth 
        century? There is no good answer to this question, except perhaps that 
        lenses and mirrors of the appropriate strengths were not available until 
        later.
In the literature of white magic, so popular in the 
        sixteenth century, there are several tantalizing references to devices 
        that would allow one to see one's enemies or count coins from a great 
        distance. But these allusions were cast in obscure language and were accompanied 
        by fantastic claims; the telescope, when it came, was a very humble and 
        simple device. It is possible that in the 1570s Leonard and Thomas Digges 
        in England actually made an instrument consisting of a convex lens and 
        a mirror, but if this proves to be the case, it was an experimental setup 
        that was never translated into a mass-produced device. [3]

The telescope was unveiled in the Netherlands. In 
        October 1608, the States General (the national government) in The Hague 
        discussed the patent applications first of Hans 
        Lipperhey of Middelburg, and then of Jacob Metius of Alkmaar, 
        on a device for "seeing faraway things as though nearby." It consisted 
        of a convex and concave lens in a tube, and the combination magnified 
        three or four times. [4] The gentlemen found the device 
        too easy to copy to award the patent, but it voted a small award to Metius 
        and employed Lipperhey to make several binocular versions, for which he 
        was paid handsomely. It appears that another citizen of Middelburg, Sacharias 
        Janssen had a telescope at about the same time but was at the Frankfurt 
        Fair where he tried to sell it.
Galileo's telescopes

The news of this new invention spread rapidly through 
        Europe, and the device itself quickly followed. By April 1609 three-powered 
        spyglasses could be bought in spectacle-maker's shops on the Pont Neuf 
        in Paris, and four months later there were several in Italy. (fig. 4) 
        We know that Thomas Harriot observed the Moon with a six-powered instrument 
        early in August 1609. But it was Galileo who made the instrument famous. 
        He constructed his first three-powered spyglass in June or July 1609, 
        presented an eight-powered instrument to the Venetian Senate in August, 
        and turned a twenty-powered instrument to the heavens in October or November. 
        With this instrument (fig. 5) he observed the Moon, discovered four satellites 
        of Jupiter, and resolved nebular patches into stars. He published Sidereus Nuncius in March 1610.
Verifying Galileo's discoveries was initially difficult. 
        In the spring of 1610 no one had telescopes of sufficient quality and 
        power to see the satellites of Jupiter, although many had weaker instruments 
        with which they could see some of the lunar detail Galileo had described 
        in Sidereus Nuncius. Galileo's lead was one of practice, not theory, 
        and it took about six months before others could make or obtain instruments 
        good enough to see Jupiter's moons. With the verification of the phases 
        of Venus by others, in the first half of 1611, Galileo's lead in telescope-making 
        had more or less evaporated. The next discovery, that of sunspots, was made by several observers, including Galileo, independently.
???
A typical Galilean telescope with which Jupiter's 
        moons could be observed was configured as follows. It had a plano-convex 
        objective (the lens toward the object) with a focal length of about 30-40 
        inches., and a plano-concave ocular with a focal length of about 2 inches. 
        The ocular was in a little tube that could be adjusted for focusing. The 
        objective lens was stopped down to an aperture of 0.5 to 1 inch. , and 
        the field of view was about 15 arc-minutes (about 15 inches in 100 yards). 
        The instrument's magnification was 15-20. The glass was full of little 
        bubbles and had a greenish tinge (caused by the iron content of the glass); 
        the shape of the lenses was reasonable good near their centers but poor 
        near the periphery (hence the restricted aperture); the polish was rather 
        poor. The limiting factor of this type of instrument was its small field 
        of view--about 15 arc-minutes--which meant that only a quarter of the 
        full Moon could be accommodated in the field. Over the next several decades, 
        lens-grinding and polishing techniques improved gradually, as a specialized 
        craft of telescope makers slowly developed. But although Galilean telescopes 
        of higher magnifications were certainly made, they were almost useless 
        because of the concomitant shrinking of the field.
As mentioned above, a the telescopic effect can be 
        achieved with different combinations of lenses and mirrors. As early as 
        1611, in his Dioptrice, Johannes 
        Kepler had shown that a telescope could also be made by combining 
        a convex objective and a convex ocular. He pointed out that such a combination 
        would produce an inverted image but showed that the addition of yet a 
        third convex lens would make the image erect again. This suggestion was 
        not immediately taken up by astronomers, however, and it was not until Christoph Scheiner published 
        his Rosa Ursina in 1630 that this form of telescope began to spread. 
        In his study of sunspots, Scheiner had experimented with telescopes with 
        convex oculars in order to make the image of the Sun projected through 
        the telescope erect. [5] But when he happened to view 
        an object directly through such an instrument, he found that, although 
        the image was inverted, it was much brighter and the field of view much 
        larger than in a Galilean telescope. Since for astronomical observations 
        an inverted image is no problem, the advantages of what became known as 
        the astronomical telescope led to its general acceptance in the astronomical 
        community by the middle of the century.
The Galilean telescope could be used for terrestrial 
        and celestial purposes interchangeably. This was not true for the astronomical 
        telescope with its inverted image. Astronomers eschewed the third convex 
        lens (the erector lens) necessary for re-inverting the image because the 
        more lenses the more optical defects multiplied. In the second half of 
        the seventeenth century, therefore, the Galilean telescope was replaced 
        for terrestrial purposes by the "terrestrial telescope," which had four 
        convex lenses: objective, ocular, erector lens, and a field lens (which 
        enlarged the field of view even further).
Hevelius's 60- and 140-foot 
            telescopes (Machina Coelestis, 1673) [click for larger image]
With the acceptance of the astronomical telescope, 
        the limit on magnification caused by the small field of view of the Galilean 
        telescope was temporarily lifted, and a "telescope race" developed. Because 
        of optical defects, the curvature of lenses had to be minimized, and therefore 
        (since the magnification of a simple telescope is given roughly by the 
        ratio of the focal lengths of the objective and ocular) increased magnification 
        had to be achieved by increasing the focal length of the objective. Beginning 
        in the 1640s, the length of telescopes began to increase. From the typical 
        Galilean telescope of 5 or 6 feet in length, astronomical telescopes rose 
        to lengths of 15 or 20 feet by the middle of the century. A typical astronomical 
        telescope is the one made by Christiaan Huygens, in 1656. It was 23 feet 
        long; its objective had an aperture of several inches, it magnified about 
        100 times, and its field of view was 17 arc-minutes.

            Huygensm Astroscopium Compendiaria,1684) [click for larger image]
Telescopes had now again reached the point where further 
        increases in magnification would restrict the field of view of the instrument 
        too much. This time another optical device, the field lens came to the 
        rescue. Adding a third convex lens--of appropriate focal length, and in 
        the right place--increased the field significantly, thus allowing higher 
        magnifications. The telescope race therefore continued unabated and lengths 
        increased exponentially. By the early 1670s, Johannes Hevelius had built 
        a 140-foot telescope.
But such long telescopes were useless for observation: 
        it was almost impossible to keep the lenses aligned and any wind would 
        make the instrument flutter. After about 1675, therefore, astronomers 
        did away with the telescope tube. The objective was mounted on a building 
        or pole by means of a ball-joint and aimed by means of a string; the image 
        was found by trial and error; and the compound eyepiece (field lens and 
        ocular), on a little stand, was then positioned to receive the image cast 
        by the objective. Such instruments were called "aerial telescopes."
Although some discoveries were made with these very 
        long instruments, this form of telescope had reached its limits. By the 
        beginning of the eighteenth century very long telescopes were rarely mounted 
        any more, and further increases of power came, beginning in the 1730s, 
        from a new form of telescope, the reflecting telescope.
Since it was known that the telescopic effect could 
        be achieved using a variety of combinations of lenses and mirrors, a number 
        of scientists speculated on combinations involving mirrors. Much of this 
        speculation was fueled by the increasingly refined theoretical study of 
        the telescope. In his Dioptrique, appended to his Discourse 
        on Method of 1637, René Descartes addressed the problem of 
        spherical aberration, already pointed out by others. In a thin spherical 
        lens, not all rays from infinity--incident parallel to the optical axis--are 
        united at one point. Those farther from the optical axis come to a focus 
        closer to the back of the lens than those nearer the optical axis. Descartes 
        had either learned the sine law of refraction from Willebrord Snell (Snell's 
        Law) [6] or had discovered it independently, and this allowed him to 
        quantify spherical aberration. In order to eliminate it, he showed, lens 
        curvature had to be either plano-hyperboloidal or spherico-ellipsoidal. 
        His demonstration led many to attempt to make plano-hyperboloidal objectives, [7] an effort which was doomed to failure by the state of the 
        art of lens-grinding. Others began considering the virtues of a concave 
        paraboloidal mirror as primary receptor: it had been known since Antiquity 
        that such a mirror would bring parallel incident rays to a focus at one 
        point.

            (1671)

A second theoretical development came in 1672, when 
        Isaac Newton published his celebrated paper on light and colors. Newton 
        showed that white light is a mixture of colored light of different refrangibility: 
        every color had its own degree of refraction. The result was that any 
        curved lens would decompose white light into the colors of the spectrum, 
        each of which comes to a focus at a different point on the optical axis. 
        This effect, which became known as chromatic aberration, resulted in a 
        central image of, e.g., a planet, being surrounded by circles of different 
        colors. Newton had developed his theory of light several years before 
        publishing his paper, when he had turned his mind to the improvement of 
        the telescope, and he had despaired of ever ridding the objective of this 
        defect. He therefore decided to try a mirror, but unlike his predecessors 
        he was able to put his idea into practice. He cast a two-inch mirror blank 
        of speculum metal (basically copper with some tin) and ground it into 
        spherical curvature. He placed it in the bottom of a tube and caught the 
        reflected rays on a 45� secondary mirror which reflected the image into 
        a convex ocular lens outside the tube (see fig. 12). He sent this little 
        instrument to the Royal Society, where it caused a sensation; it was the 
        first working reflecting telescope. But the effort ended there. Others 
        were unable to grind mirrors of regular curvature, and to add to the problem, 
        the mirror tarnished and had to be repolished every few months, with the 
        attending danger of damage to the curvature.

The reflecting telescope therefore remained a curiosity 
        for decades. In second and third decades of the eighteenth century, however, 
        the reflecting telescope became a reality in the hands of first James 
        Hadley and then others. By the middle of the century, reflecting telescopes 
        with primary mirrors up to six inches in diameter had been made. It was 
        found that for large aperture ratios (the ratio of focal length of the 
        primary to its aperture, as the f-ratio in modern cameras for instance), 
        f/10 or more, the difference between spherical and paraboloidal mirrors 
        was negligible in the performance of the telescope. In the second half 
        of the eighteenth century, in the hands of James Short and then William 
        Herschel, the reflecting telescope with parabolically ground mirrors came 
        into its own.
Notes: [1] They may have developed independently in China.
[2] Note that the word lens was used only to denote
convex lenses until the end of the seventeenth century.
[3] The claim for an "Elizabethan telescope" has recently been
made by Colin Ronin, who has demonstrated an instrument based on the writings
of Thomas Digges and William Bourne.
[4] Their optical system and magnification was the same as our
traditional opera glasses
[5] The Galilean telescope produces an erect image of an
object viewed directly but an inverted image of a projected object; by
substituting a convex for the concave ocular, this situation is reversed.
[6] The ratio of the sines of the angles of incidence and
refraction is constant.
[7] The effect is most apparent for the objective; spherical
aberration in the ocular affects the image much less.
