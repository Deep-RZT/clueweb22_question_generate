What my clients say...
slide 6 of 6
Jo and I would like to thank Celeste for the very professional service that she gave us when we decided to move from France to La Alcaidesa. She was spot on in understanding our requirements and, when we found the right property,  she ensured that the whole conveyancing process went through very smoothly and quickly. But what impressed us was that, after we moved in, Celeste ensured that we discovered all the local services in the area. This was our 5th house move and we can honestly say that she helped to make this the easiest.
Mike & Jo from the UK
Since the first moment, Celeste was very professional!! The best ever Real Estate Agent I've met so far! The information provided was very personalized and extended to meet our requirements! The best!
Joaquim Soares from Portugal
Celeste is a very professional Real Estate Agent. She knows the area extremely well and is therefore very capable of showing the right properties. She is very customer-focused, friendly and goes the extra mile to keep her clients happy. We are very happy with her help and would recommend her to all who are looking for real estate in the area!
Saida & Hachim from the Netherlands
We were in contact with several real estate agents but the one that gave us the most confidence is The Property Agent owned by Mrs Celeste Alonso. We met an exceptional person through the internet following our research, and I must tell you that we are delighted! This beautiful meeting was decisive; it is a person who proves the real qualities of professionalism. She took charge of us from beginning to end. Arrived in Spain in Malaga, she accompanied us for visits to different apartments, and we found a rare pearl thanks to Celeste.
Mr and Mrs Catteau from France
Celeste is the reason we bought our property. Her knowledge of the market and her ability to find gems in the residential real estate sector are second to none. Time and again, she has proven to be reliable and extremely trustworthy. She provided us with immeasurable support during the purchase and also while we were decorating and renovating our apartment. Celeste's network of contacts has been invaluable to us.. If you are looking to rent or buy a property, we consider Celeste to be the best at what she does. Don’t settle for anyone else! Five stars!
Marzia & Satya from Italy
We decided to work with Celeste from our first conversation by telephone. We liked her approach and very good care of customers. Celeste supported us not only before and during the purchase, but also after the purchase was successfully completed. Celeste really helped us a lot. We are happy that in Spain we have a great friend of ours! Be sure that we will recommend Celeste like the best Real Estate Agent in Spain.
