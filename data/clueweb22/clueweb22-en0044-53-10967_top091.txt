I'm looking for an aftermarket remote starter since the stealer's remote starters still uses the valet key. Now do I want a remote starter only or the remote starter and security? Do I really need all the added security on these after market systems like shock sensors, glass breakage...etc. All I really want is a remote start but can't stop looking at the high end ones with LCD screens on the remote FOB that provide you with feedback and temp of interior. Now if I get the remote start only does that render my factory alarm useless? Now some remote starters can turn on your car using an iPihone, Blackberry, WOW this is some cool stuff. One draw back is the yearly service plan you need to purchase in order to use it on the smartphones. This remote starter and security is pretty new to me. Lastly viper, clifford, python which brand is best or what they are known for?

DEI is one of the big brands but Compustar has the same features and computrak and compulink to enable you to use your cellphone and to track your vehicle, turn it on, text page you if there is a break-in etc.

I have a 2007 Honda Pilot, which of these remote starts are the best?

I have a one-way viper inthe Pilot and the wife loves it. Basic unit.
My FX-35 has a basic 2-way system (which I love of course) I would stay away from the LCD screen ones - the remotes tend to break easily and are costly to replace!
PM sent with a contact for you.... (in LI)

can you please send me your contact for the viper system install as well. I am still debating which one I should get. 5902,5901 or just a simple viper system. What's the difference between a 2 way and 1 way? I want to add the auto windows up module, is that possible on the pilot? does your contact know how to have the viper system co-exist with the factory system? what's the benefit of having the viper system co-exist with the factory one?
thanks

2-way systems give you confirmation on the remote when you're in range (i.e. armed, disarmed, remote start, etc.) 1-way systems function like the OEM setup.
I want to add the auto windows up module, is that possible on the pilot?
Yes.....DEI 530t is the most common module. It can control 4-windows going one motion. If you want the roll the windows down, you'll need 2 modules.
what's the benefit of having the viper system co-exist with the factory one?
Having both systems give you 2 layers of protection. If the new system is installed properly, the OEM system will disarm and arm in conjunction with the aftermarket one. Operation should be seamless.

Not sure if the extra $$$ is worth it for the window options. I love my 2-way system I can start my FX from my desk at work and it confirms (LED blink and beep) if the car got the signal etc.
The range on the newer units is incredible - even my 5 year old system is decent! 3-4 times the range from the OEM key fob.
In the attached pic you can see the lights are the top 4 colored sections. Double press the bottom right orange button and unit blinks and beep to confirm car got the signal to start. (similar confirmation when you lock/unlock)
What I did loose is the horn honk to confirm lock etc - but the remote does it now so no anoying honk anymore!
You can still us the OEM key to lock unlock also (this will produce the horn honk confirmation - which is also the alarm I believe)

Amazon currently sells the Viper-5902 for $299. Any idea how much one would pay for installation?

All of the shops I know of in the DC area won't install alarms not purchased from them because of warranty issues. DEI doesn't authorize internet sales of the Viper line so buying through Amazon/Wazingo will result in no warranty support from the manufacturer. Just to give you a price reference, the 5902 typically sells for $700 installed.

For aftermarket remote starter. You better of getting the full pkg. w/ 2 way alarm system. The remote starter is so convenient and having the 2 way system confirms the the car started or not. If your in range it will also notify you if your car alarm goes off. I have a viper 5900 installed on my car 4yrs ago and it's all worth it! All alarm system mentioned above is all good and will come down to your personal preference. Either brand you decide just go with the certified dealer on their site to have it installed. Shop around and see which dealer will give the best deal and install extra functions your system is capable not just the basic. goodluck!

Great info! Thanks!!!
Also, on some remote start systems one need to stop the car before one can unlock the doors. Is it the same with Vipor, or is it great&simple like this:
1. Remote Start (from Vipor remote)
2. Unlock Doors (from Vipor remote)
3. Start the car and drive away

Yes but in the last step, you just have to turn the key to ON and then step on the brake - this will take it out of remote start mode and allow you to drive as you normally do.

I have been pricing the Viper 5901 and 5902 out and at Best Buy and a smaller place near my house in Nor California it's between $700 and $800 if you purchase and have the system installed at the same place. Main thing to know is you need the optional immobilizer which they will charge you an extra $100 for.

Would you mind sending me a contact out to me as well please? I've been sitting this on a year and want to get it done.

Turning the key to ON and stepping on the brake...I think that's impossible not to do since you have to put the car into gear, right? I mean, its a good thing, it sounds intuitive.

Isn't the immobilizer standard I would think? Its an extra?
One question that has Im thinking since someone mentioned windows:
If I get one of these aftermarket systems (I need a 2 way, and am siding with a non-LCD version), and I get the included fob, I want to be able ot start the car, unlcok and get in and drive off. But if want to, can I still use my original Honda key/fob to roll down the windows a bit if I wanted to?

It should be standard on alarms with remote start but places like Best Buy charge extra. B&M shops will usually include it in their quote. When you're shopping around just make sure all of the features you're looking for are included in the price. Also do not let any shop install the immobilizer bypass that requires you to sacrifice a key. The latest modules can be programmed to the data stream of the factory immobilizer system.

Yes but roll them down before you arm the system. If you do it while armed, you might trigger the shock sensor. An aftermarket system can do this as well but will require additional labor and/or parts.

I called 3 places today asking about the Viper 5901. (I prefer the non-led one but I started with that 2 way.)
One place quoted $550 installed with burying the key in a module.
One guy was rushed and quoted a 2 day special on remotestarters, starting at $149 on a code alarm. I immediately asked the price for a the Viper 5901 and he either said $349 or 399. I assume also with that valet Key.
The other I didnt hear from yet.
I will see the guy who quoted me 349-399 on Weds and if it sounds legit, I think its a done deal.
BTW, that extra valet key is completely useless to us, sitting in a drawer in the kitchen. So why not give it up as its never used?

It's a potential security hole. If a thief finds the box with the key in it, he can hotwire the car. Besides, it's 15-year old technology . The newer interface modules are better/more secure and will actually make the install easier for the shop.

Thanks. So don't give up[ the valet key! much appreciated!
Although, if it runs cheaper and I were to bury the key, doesnt it just have to be somewhere in the car? In other words, once hte install is done, if I chose to give up the valet key, could I ask were the key was and pull it from its spot and hide elsewhere?
