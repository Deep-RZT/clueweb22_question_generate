Prior to 1600
From the dawn of history until the beginning of the 17th century the known universe consisted of only 8 bodies:
Earth
    Sun
    Moon
    Mercury
    Venus
    Mars
    Jupiter
    Saturn
plus the “fixed” stars. These are the ones that can be seen easily without any optical instruments. In Europe, the prevailing view was the Ptolemaic system with the Earth at the center and the other bodies revolving around it.
The 17th Century
In 1610 when Galileo first turned a telescope on the heavens and our knowledge of the universe exploded. By the end of the 17th century, 9 new bodies had been discovered and Copernicus’s heliocentric theory was widely accepted. The total number of known bodies had more than doubled to 17:

The 19th Century
The number of bodies in the solar system increased dramatically in the 19th century with the discovery of the asteroids (464 of which were known at by 1899) but only 9 more “major” bodies were discovered. The number of major bodies rose to 31 (almost double the 17th century total):

The CCD Age
Dozens more small moons have been discovered in recent years with large ground based telescopes and CCD cameras. There are well over 100 now known; See JPL’s site for more details.
