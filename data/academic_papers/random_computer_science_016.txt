Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) can greatly improve the signal
quality of future communication systems by reflecting transmitted signals
toward the receiver. However, even when the base station (BS) has perfect
channel knowledge and can compute the optimal RIS phase-shift configuration,
implementing this configuration requires feedback signaling over a control
channel from the BS to the RIS. This feedback must be kept minimal, as it is
transmitted wirelessly every time the channel changes. In this paper, we
examine how the feedback load, measured in bits, affects the performance of an
RIS-aided system. Specifically, we investigate the trade-offs between
codebook-based and element-wise feedback schemes, and how these influence the
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). We propose a novel quantization codebook tailored
for line-of-sight (LoS) that guarantees a minimal SNR loss using a number of
feedback bits that scale logarithmically with the number of RIS elements. We
demonstrate the codebook's usefulness over Rician fading channels and how to
extend it to handle a non-zero static path. Numerical simulations and
analytical analysis are performed to quantify the performance degradation that
results from a reduced feedback load, shedding light on how efficiently RIS
configurations can be fed back in practical systems.
