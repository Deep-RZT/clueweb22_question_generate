Abstract: Mechanical stresses in soft materials across different length scales play a
fundamental role in understanding the function of biological systems and in the
use of artificial materials for engineering soft machines and biomedical
devices. Yet it remains a great challenge to probe local mechanical stresses in
situ in a non-invasive, non-destructive manner, in particular when the
mechanical properties are unknown. To address this challenge, we propose an
acoustoelastic imaging-based method to infer the local mechanical stresses in
soft materials by measuring the speed of shear waves induced by
custom-programmed acoustic radiation force. Using a medical ultrasound
transducer to excite and track the shear waves remotely, we demonstrate the
application of the method by imaging uniaxial stress and bending stress in an
isotropic hydrogel, and the passive uniaxial stress in a skeletal muscle. These
measurements were all done without the knowledge of the constitutive parameters
of the materials. These examples indicate that our method will find broad
applications, ranging from health monitoring of soft structures and machines,
to the diagnosis of diseases that alter stresses in soft tissues.
