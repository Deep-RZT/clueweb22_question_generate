Title: First-order phase transitions in the cores of neutron stars

Authors: Oleg Komoltsev

Abstract: I explore various scenarios for the phase transition within neutron-star
matter. I do so by generating large model-agnostic ensemble using Gaussian
processes, both with and without explicit inclusion of first-order phase
transitions (FOPTs). The ensemble is conditioned with state-of-the-art
astrophysical and theoretical inputs in a fully Bayesian approach. I study how
the current data affect the posterior probability of the location and the
strength of FOPT. I find that the previously observed peak structure of the
sound speed remains stable against inclusion of FOPTs. While the current data
cannot differentiate between a smooth crossover and a first-order phase
transition, 91% of the total evidence consists of equations of state with some
form of phase changes, such as FOPT occurring within or terminating the stable
branch of neutron stars, or an indication of a crossover to quark matter.
