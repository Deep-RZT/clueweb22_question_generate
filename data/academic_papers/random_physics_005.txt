Title: Test of conformal gravity as an alternative to dark matter from the
  observations of elliptical galaxies

Authors: Li-Xue Yue, Da-Ming Chen

Abstract: As an alternative gravitational theory to General Relativity (GR), the
Conformal Gravity (CG) has recently been successfully verified by observations
of Type Ia supernovae (SN Ia) and the rotation curves of spiral galaxies. The
observations of galaxies only pertain to the non-relativistic form of gravity.
In this context, within the framework of the Newtonian theory of gravity (the
non-relativistic form of GR), dark matter is postulated to account for the
observations. On the other hand, the non-relativistic form of CG predicts an
additional potential: besides the Newtonian potential, there is a so-called
linear potential term, characterized by the parameter $\gamma^*$, as an
alternative to dark matter in Newtonian gravity. To test CG in its
non-relativistic form, much work has been done by fitting the predictions to
the observations of circular velocity (rotation curves) for spiral galaxies. In
this paper, we test CG with the observations from elliptical galaxies. Instead
of the circular velocities for spiral galaxies, we use the velocity dispersion
for elliptical galaxies. By replacing the Newtonian potential with that
predicted by non-relativistic form of CG in Hamiltonian, we directly extend the
Jeans equation derived in Newtonian theory to that for CG. By comparing the
results derived from the ellipticals with that from spirals, we find that the
extra potential predicted by CG is not sufficient to account for the
observations of ellipticals. Furthermore, we discover a strong correlation
between $\gamma^*$ and the stellar mass $M^*$ in dwarf spheroidal galaxies.
This finding implies that the variation in $\gamma^*$ violates a fundamental
prediction of Conformal Gravity (CG), which posits that $\gamma^*$ should be a
universal constant.
