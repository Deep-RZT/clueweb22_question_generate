Title: A Novel Approach to Linking Histology Images with DNA Methylation

Abstract: DNA methylation is an epigenetic mechanism that regulates gene expression by
adding methyl groups to DNA. Abnormal methylation patterns can disrupt gene
expression and have been linked to cancer development. To quantify DNA
methylation, specialized assays are typically used. However, these assays are
often costly and have lengthy processing times, which limits their widespread
availability in routine clinical practice. In contrast, whole slide images
(WSIs) for the majority of cancer patients can be more readily available. As
such, given the ready availability of WSIs, there is a compelling need to
explore the potential relationship between WSIs and DNA methylation patterns.
To address this, we propose an end-to-end graph neural network based weakly
supervised learning framework to predict the methylation state of gene groups
exhibiting coherent patterns across samples. Using data from three cohorts from
The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) - TCGA-LGG (Brain Lower Grade Glioma), TCGA-GBM
(Glioblastoma Multiforme) ($n$=729) and TCGA-KIRC (Kidney Renal Clear Cell
Carcinoma) ($n$=511) - we demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves
significantly higher AUROC scores than the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, by
more than $20\%$. We conduct gene set enrichment analyses on the gene groups
and show that majority of the gene groups are significantly enriched in
important hallmarks and pathways. We also generate spatially enriched heatmaps
to further investigate links between histological patterns and DNA methylation
states. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that explores
association of spatially resolved histological patterns with gene group
methylation states across multiple cancer types using weakly supervised deep
learning.
