Title: An integrated method for clustering and association network inference

Authors: Jeanne Tous, Julien Chiquet

Abstract: We consider high dimensional Gaussian graphical models inference. These
models provide a rigorous framework to describe a network of statistical
dependencies between entities, such as genes in genomic regulation studies or
species in ecology. Penalized methods, including the standard Graphical-Lasso,
are well-known approaches to infer the parameters of these models. As the
number of variables in the model (of entities in the network) grow, the network
inference and interpretation become more complex. We propose Normal-Block, a
new model that clusters variables and consider a network at the cluster level.
Normal-Block both adds structure to the network and reduces its size. We build
on Graphical-Lasso to add a penalty on the network's edges and limit the
detection of spurious dependencies, we also propose a zero-inflated version of
the model to account for real-world data properties. For the inference
procedure, we propose a direct heuristic method and another more rigorous one
that simultaneously infers the clustering of variables and the association
network between clusters, using a penalized variational
Expectation-Maximization approach. An implementation of the model in R, in a
package called normalblockr, is available on github
(https://github.com/jeannetous/normalblockr). We present the results in terms
of clustering and network inference using both simulated data and various types
of real-world data (proteomics, words occurrences on webpages, and microbiota
distribution).
