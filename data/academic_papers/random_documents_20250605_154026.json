    "abstract": "DNA methylation is an epigenetic mechanism that regulates gene expression by\nadding methyl groups to DNA. Abnormal methylation patterns can disrupt gene\nexpression and have been linked to cancer development. To quantify DNA\nmethylation, specialized assays are typically used. However, these assays are\noften costly and have lengthy processing times, which limits their widespread\navailability in routine clinical practice. In contrast, whole slide images\n(WSIs) for the majority of cancer patients can be more readily available. As\nsuch, given the ready availability of WSIs, there is a compelling need to\nexplore the potential relationship between WSIs and DNA methylation patterns.\nTo address this, we propose an end-to-end graph neural network based weakly\nsupervised learning framework to predict the methylation state of gene groups\nexhibiting coherent patterns across samples. Using data from three cohorts from\nThe Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) - TCGA-LGG (Brain Lower Grade Glioma), TCGA-GBM\n(Glioblastoma Multiforme) ($n$=729) and TCGA-KIRC (Kidney Renal Clear Cell\nCarcinoma) ($n$=511) - we demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves\nsignificantly higher AUROC scores than the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, by\nmore than $20\\%$. We conduct gene set enrichment analyses on the gene groups\nand show that majority of the gene groups are significantly enriched in\nimportant hallmarks and pathways. We also generate spatially enriched heatmaps\nto further investigate links between histological patterns and DNA methylation\nstates. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that explores\nassociation of spatially resolved histological patterns with gene group\nmethylation states across multiple cancer types using weakly supervised deep\nlearning.",

Rajpoot\n\nAbstract: DNA methylation is an epigenetic mechanism that regulates gene expression by\nadding methyl groups to DNA. Abnormal methylation patterns can disrupt gene\nexpression and have been linked to cancer development. To quantify DNA\nmethylation, specialized assays are typically used. However, these assays are\noften costly and have lengthy processing times, which limits their widespread\navailability in routine clinical practice. In contrast, whole slide images\n(WSIs) for the majority of cancer patients can be more readily available. As\nsuch, given the ready availability of WSIs, there is a compelling need to\nexplore the potential relationship between WSIs and DNA methylation patterns.\nTo address this, we propose an end-to-end graph neural network based weakly\nsupervised learning framework to predict the methylation state of gene groups\nexhibiting coherent patterns across samples. Using data from three cohorts from\nThe Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) - TCGA-LGG (Brain Lower Grade Glioma), TCGA-GBM\n(Glioblastoma Multiforme) ($n$=729) and TCGA-KIRC (Kidney Renal Clear Cell\nCarcinoma) ($n$=511) - we demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves\nsignificantly higher AUROC scores than the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, by\nmore than $20\\%$. We conduct gene set enrichment analyses on the gene groups\nand show that majority of the gene groups are significantly enriched in\nimportant hallmarks and pathways. We also generate spatially enriched heatmaps\nto further investigate links between histological patterns and DNA methylation\nstates. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that explores\nassociation of spatially resolved histological patterns with gene group\nmethylation states across multiple cancer types using weakly supervised deep\nlearning.\n\nIntroduction: Recent advances in this field have opened new possibilities for innovative applications. This research addresses current limitations and proposes novel solutions.\n\nMethodology: We employed rigorous experimental protocols and advanced computational techniques to validate our approach. Statistical analysis was performed to ensure result reliability.\n\nResults: The experimental data shows significant improvements over baseline methods. Key performance indicators demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.\n\nDiscussion: These findings contribute to the current understanding of the field and provide insights for future research directions. Potential applications span multiple domains.\n\nConclusion: This work presents a significant advancement in the field with practical implications for real-world applications.",

    "title": "What Makes Treatment Effects Identifiable? Characterizations and\n  Estimators Beyond Unconfoundedness",
    "abstract": "Most of the widely used estimators of the average treatment effect (ATE) in\ncausal inference rely on the assumptions of unconfoundedness and overlap.\nUnconfoundedness requires that the observed covariates account for all\ncorrelations between the outcome and treatment. Overlap requires the existence\nof randomness in treatment decisions for all individuals. Nevertheless, many\ntypes of studies frequently violate unconfoundedness or overlap, for instance,\nobservational studies with deterministic treatment decisions -- popularly known\nas Regression Discontinuity designs -- violate overlap.\n  In this paper, we initiate the study of general conditions that enable the\nidentification of the average treatment effect, extending beyond\nunconfoundedness and overlap. In particular, following the paradigm of\nstatistical learning theory, we provide an interpretable condition that is\nsufficient and nearly necessary for the identification of ATE.

Characterizations and\n  Estimators Beyond Unconfoundedness\n\nAuthors: Yang Cai, Alkis Kalavasis, Katerina Mamali, Anay Mehrotra, Manolis Zampetakis\n\nAbstract: Most of the widely used estimators of the average treatment effect (ATE) in\ncausal inference rely on the assumptions of unconfoundedness and overlap.\nUnconfoundedness requires that the observed covariates account for all\ncorrelations between the outcome and treatment. Overlap requires the existence\nof randomness in treatment decisions for all individuals. Nevertheless, many\ntypes of studies frequently violate unconfoundedness or overlap, for instance,\nobservational studies with deterministic treatment decisions -- popularly known\nas Regression Discontinuity designs -- violate overlap.\n  In this paper, we initiate the study of general conditions that enable the\nidentification of the average treatment effect, extending beyond\nunconfoundedness and overlap.

    "title": "EPiC: Towards Lossless Speedup for Reasoning Training through\n  Edge-Preserving CoT Condensation",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities\nwhen trained with chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision. However, the long and\nverbose CoT traces, especially those distilled from large reasoning models\n(LRMs) such as DeepSeek-R1, significantly increase training costs during the\ndistillation process, where a non-reasoning base model is taught to replicate\nthe reasoning behavior of an LRM. In this work, we study the problem of CoT\ncondensation for resource-efficient reasoning training, aimed at pruning\nintermediate reasoning steps (i.e., thoughts) in CoT traces, enabling\nsupervised model training on length-reduced CoT data while preserving both\nanswer accuracy and the model's ability to generate coherent reasoning. Our\nrationale is that CoT traces typically follow a three-stage structure: problem\nunderstanding, exploration, and solution convergence. Through empirical\nanalysis, we find that retaining the structure of the reasoning trace,\nespecially the early stage of problem understanding (rich in reflective cues)\nand the final stage of solution convergence, is sufficient to achieve lossless\nreasoning supervision. To this end, we propose an Edge-Preserving Condensation\nmethod, EPiC, which selectively retains only the initial and final segments of\neach CoT trace while discarding the middle portion. This design draws an\nanalogy to preserving the \"edge\" of a reasoning trajectory, capturing both the\ninitial problem framing and the final answer synthesis, to maintain logical\ncontinuity.
