Title: On the Coverage Required for Diploid Genome Assembly

Authors: Daanish Mahajan, Chirag Jain, Navin Kashyap

Abstract: The repeat content and heterozygosity rate of a target genome are important
factors in determining the feasibility of achieving a complete
telomere-to-telomere assembly. The mathematical relationship between the
required coverage and read length for the purpose of unique reconstruction
remains unexplored for diploid genomes. We investigate the
information-theoretic conditions that the given set of sequencing reads must
satisfy to achieve the complete reconstruction of the true sequence of a
diploid genome. We also analyze the standard greedy and de-Bruijn graph-based
assembly algorithms. Our results show that the coverage and read length
requirements of the assembly algorithms are considerably higher than the lower
bound because both algorithms require the double repeats in the genome to be
bridged. Finally, we derive the necessary conditions for the overlap
graph-based assembly paradigm.
