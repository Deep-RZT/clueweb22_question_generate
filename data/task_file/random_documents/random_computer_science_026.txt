Abstract: Understanding and addressing corner cases is essential for ensuring the
safety and reliability of autonomous driving systems. Vision-language models
(VLMs) play a crucial role in enhancing scenario comprehension, yet they face
significant challenges, such as hallucination and insufficient real-world
grounding, which compromise their performance in critical driving scenarios. In
this work, RAC3, a novel framework designed to enhance the performance of VLMs
in corner case comprehension, is proposed. RAC3 integrates a frequency-spatial
fusion (FSF) image encoder, a cross-modal alignment training method for
embedding models with hard and semi-hard negative mining, and a fast querying
and retrieval pipeline based on K-Means clustering and hierarchical navigable
small world (HNSW) indexing. A multimodal chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting
strategy to guide analogical reasoning and reduce hallucinations during
inference is introduced. Moreover, an update mechanism is integrated into RAC3
to ensure continual learning within the framework. Extensive experiments on the
CODA and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that RAC3 significantly improves corner
case comprehension across multiple downstream tasks. Compared to prior
state-of-the-art methods, RAC3 achieves the highest final score of 74.46 on the
CODA-LM benchmark and shows consistent performance gains when integrated with
end-to-end frameworks like DriveLM. These results demonstrate the effectiveness
of retrieval-augmented strategies and cross-modal alignment for safer and more
interpretable autonomous driving.
