  Biological Networks

Authors: Hernan A. Makse, Paolo Boldi, Francesco Sorrentino, Ian Stewart

Abstract: A symmetry is a `change without change'. As simple as it sounds, this concept
is the fundamental cornerstone that unifies all branches of theoretical
physics. Virtually all physical laws -- ranging from classical mechanics and
electrodynamics to relativity, quantum mechanics, and the standard model -- can
be expressed in terms of symmetry invariances. In this book, we explore whether
the same principle can also explain the emergent laws of biological systems. We
introduce a new geometry for biological networks and AI architectures, drawing
inspiration from the mystic genius of Grothendieck's fibrations in category
theory. We attempt to bridge the gap between physics and biology using
symmetries but with a twist. The traditional symmetry groups of physics are
global and too rigid to describe biology. Instead, the novel notion of symmetry
fibration is local, flexible, and adaptable to evolutionary pressures,
providing the right framework for understanding biological complexity. In other
words, this more general symmetry invariance is necessary and sufficient to
ensure that a given biological network configuration can support a synchronized
function. In this book, we review the theoretical progress over the last
decades from mathematics, physics, computer science, dynamical systems, and
graph theory that has led to the discovery of symmetry fibrations in biological
networks. These symmetries act as organizing principles for biological
networks. They serve as effective tools for describing the structure of these
networks, blending geometry and topology. Fibrations explain how structure
dictates function across various biological domains, including the
transcriptome, proteome, metabolome, and connectome. Additionally, they
facilitate a reduction in the dimensionality of the network, simplifying it
into its fundamental building blocks for biological computation.
