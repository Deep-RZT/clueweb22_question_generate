Title: Interactive Databases for the Life Sciences

Authors: Rosalia Moreddu

Abstract: In the past few decades, the life sciences have experienced an unprecedented
accumulation of data, ranging from genomic sequences and proteomic profiles to
heavy-content imaging, clinical assays, and commercial biological products for
research. Traditional static databases have been invaluable in providing
standardized and structured information. However, they fall short when it comes
to facilitating exploratory data interrogation, real-time query,
multidimensional comparison and dynamic visualization. Interactive databases
aiming at supporting user-driven data queries and visualization offer promising
new avenues for making the best use of the vast and heterogeneous data streams
collected in biological research. This article discusses the potential of
interactive databases, highlighting the importance of implementing this model
in the life sciences, while going through the state-of-the-art in database
design, technical choices behind modern data management systems, and emerging
needs in multidisciplinary research. Special attention is given to data
interrogation strategies, user interface design, and comparative analysis
capabilities, along with challenges such as data standardization and
scalability in data-heavy applications. Conceptual features for developing
interactive databases along diverse life science domains are then presented in
the user case of cell line selection for in vitro research to bridge the gap
between research data generation, actionable biological insight, subsequent
meaningful experimental design, and clinical relevance.
