Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of accurately detecting the transition
from the warmup phase to the steady state in performance metric time series,
which is a critical step for effective benchmarking. The goal is to introduce a
method that avoids premature or delayed detection, which can lead to inaccurate
or inefficient performance analysis. The proposed approach adapts techniques
from the chemical reactors domain, detecting steady states online through the
combination of kernel-based step detection and statistical methods. By using a
window-based approach, it provides detailed information and improves the
accuracy of identifying phase transitions, even in noisy or irregular time
series. Results show that the new approach reduces total error by 14.5%
compared to the state-of-the-art method. It offers more reliable detection of
the steady-state onset, delivering greater precision for benchmarking tasks.
For users, the new approach enhances the accuracy and stability of performance
benchmarking, efficiently handling diverse time series data. Its robustness and
adaptability make it a valuable tool for real-world performance evaluation,
ensuring consistent and reproducible results.
