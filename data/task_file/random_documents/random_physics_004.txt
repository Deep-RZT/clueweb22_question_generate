Abstract: Background: Mechanical Thrombectomy (MT) is a widely accepted first-line
treatment for Acute Ischemic Stroke (AIS) and it has been studied using in
vitro and in silico models. Thrombectomy outcomes have been performed for
patient-specific cases using in silico models. However, until now, in vivo
friction coefficients for stent-vessel, stent-clot, and clot-vessel
interactions are unknown, but in vitro experiments have been attempted with
significant standard deviations. These interactions and friction coefficients
have been considered an important aspect of thrombectomy success. Objectives:
In the current study, we explored the influence of variation in friction forces
for stent-vessel, stent-clot, and clot-vessel interactions using virtual
mechanical thrombectomy (VMT). We have performed three simulations for each
interaction and varied friction coefficients around the standard deviation
observed in the past in vitro studies. Results: (i) clot-vessel friction:
higher friction leads to clot fragmentation and VMT failure. (ii) stent-clot
friction: it is susceptible to VMT outcomes, with lower values showing the
slippage of the clot while higher values lead to fragmentation. (iii)
stent-vessel friction: higher friction shows compression of the stent in curved
vessels and dislodgment of clot from stent retriever (SR) due to its
compression, which leads to VMT failure. (iv) retrieval speed (RS): higher RS
(>30 mm/s) leads to significant stent compression and unrealistic behavior of
the SR. Conclusions: Analysis of results proposes the necessity for calculating
accurate friction factor values and their implementation into in silico models,
due to their sensitivity towards thrombectomy outcomes. Such in silico models
mimic in vivo thrombectomy more closely and can be used in mechanical
thrombectomy planning, management, and decision-making.
