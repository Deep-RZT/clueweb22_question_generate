Abstract: Mathematical analysis of the spectral properties of the time evolution
operator in quantum walks is essential for understanding key dynamical
behaviors such as localization and long-term evolution. The inhomogeneous
three-state case, in particular, poses substantial analytical challenges due to
its higher internal degrees of freedom and the absence of translational
invariance. We develop a general framework for the spectral analysis of
three-state quantum walks on the one-dimensional lattice with arbitrary time
evolution operators. Our novel approach is based on a transfer matrix
formulation that reduces the infinite-dimensional eigenvalue problem to a
tractable system of two-dimensional recursions, enabling exact characterization
of localized eigenstates. This framework applies broadly to space-inhomogeneous
models, including those with finite defects and two-phase structures. We
rigorously derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of
discrete eigenvalues, along with a complete description of the corresponding
eigenvalues and eigenstates, which are known to underlie quantum localization
phenomena. Using this method, we perform exact numerical analyses of the
Fourier walk with spatial inhomogeneity, revealing the emergence of
localization despite its delocalized nature in the homogeneous case. Our
results provide mathematical tools and physical insights into the structure of
quantum walks, offering a systematic path for identifying and characterizing
localized quantum states in complex quantum systems.
