Telescope - Renaissance:Technology and Innovation
The Telescope
How did
this invention or innovation assist in completing work? How was work done
previously?
The telescope assisted in seeing things beyond a man's abilities and senses. This invention magnified everything they saw through the disks of glass (in other words, lenses). Before, observations were done from the nature of men, through their perspective of vision, which did not extend to a far point. The telescope led to more accurate observations that led to theories about the sun and about our Solar System.
What social, cultural, political, and economic impacts did this invention have on society?
Using the telescope, the famous astronomer, Galileo, discovered that the Earth revolves around the sun, refuting the belief that the sun revolved around the earth. Because of this finding using the telescope, the hierarchy of Italy was outraged by his theory (in which we know is absolutely true) because it rejected ancient beliefs and legacies passed down from generations. The invention of the telescope was related to the creation of lenses, which many scientists and craftsmen purchased to create magnifying objects, such as glasses.
