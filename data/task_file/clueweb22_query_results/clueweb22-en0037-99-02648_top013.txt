In which part of Spain is the Costa del Sol?
The Costa del Sol can be found on the southern coast of Spain, stretching from Gibraltar in the west, to Nerja in the east. Falling mainly within the province of Málaga, it encompasses over 160 km of idyllic Mediterranean coastline and is home to some of Spain's best beach destinatons such as Torremolinos, Fuengirola and of course Marbella. The Costa del Sol is a first-class destination for foreigners on the hunt for property for sale in Spain. Whether it be an apartment in Estepona or a villa on the Golden Mile, the Costa del Sol has a home for everyone.
What is the Costa del Sol like?
With almost 3,000 hours of sunshine a year and an average of only 70 days with rainfall a year, the Costa del Sol did not earn its name by chance. This fantastic climate allows you to make plans for practically any day of the year. It is no wonder that some of the world's best golf courses can be found here. If golf isn't your thing, the 116 stunning beaches, 13 marinas, street markets, fantastic shopping opportunities and first-class restaurants may be the answer.
An international melting pot with foreign residents and second-homers from the four corners of the world, the Costa del Sol is well prepared to deal with foreign buyers in many languages.
The Costa del Sol is easily accessed via the international airport in Malaga which serves over 120 destinations each week, making it not just a place for full-time relocation but also a feasible destination for weekend trips or short breaks throughout the year.
The Costa del Sol boasts a wonderful network of upgraded road and rail links which means moving around the region is a delight. Málaga also offers the AVE - High-speed rail service, enabling you to be in Madrid in just 2 hours 40 minutes.
Healthcare in Spain is widely envied across Europe and rightly so. Hospitals, clinics and local surgeries are all very professional, offering modern facilities and relatively short waiting lists. The Costa del Sol is no exception, with plenty of public and private hospitals as well as a long list of specialist clinics.
Like most of Spain, local festivities are constantly on the go throughout the year but the most intense season is of course summer when the majority of the patron saint festivals take place. In addition, Malaga offers one of the most admired Easter celebrations, as well as one of the biggest San Juan festivals in Spain to celebrate the start of summer.

When you start your house hunting journey it will most likely begin in Marbella. However, you are spoilt for choice  when it comes to well-consolidated coastal resorts, not to mention the idyllic and peaceful white villages - Pueblos Blancos - if you move a little inland.
