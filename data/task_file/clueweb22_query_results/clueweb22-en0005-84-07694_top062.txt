It has been proven that with the constant use of the TARBAR filters ,much of the harmfull substances will REMAIN in the FILTER and not enter your LUNGS. The centrifugal force pushes much of the impurities to the sides of the filter preventing them from entering your lungs.

A great decision to use these
I am a heavy smoker. The habit is very hard to quit, and i know i need to. Thing is, it is not that easy since i been smoking for 30+ years. I have gotten to the point of walking 5 foot and being out of breath. Doing this for so long, i tried quitting, but the stress just makes me pick that next cigarette up. I bought these in hopes that they help. After using these for 2 weeks, my breathing is so much better. The tar is not going into my lungs like it would without these. The junk is coming up and i can walk across my yard now. I highly recommend these if a person cannot quit, but needs to breathe. The tar that these things catch is amazing. I will not smoke without these again, knowing what goes into my lungs, and being able to be active again!!!!!!!

Will buy another brand!
I have bought these previously and they fit the cigarette filter snuggle. This time they were very loose fitting. Makes using them impossible! More than half in each package are too big! Poor quality!

They work!!
I can say myself that after using these for just a few days, they make a huge difference. I’m not hacking up crap and it feels like my lung capacity has improved quite a bit. They do lighten the taste, but after a couple days you won’t even notice. I get about 3-4 cigarettes per filter, any more and you risk tasting that nasty tar. But since they are clear it’s easy to see when a new one is needed. I love em!!

Great product
It's amazing how much tar these simple plastic filters remove from cigarettes. I'm able to use each filter for 3 cigs, so they're a good value for me. After a week of using them, I can definitely tell the difference with my breathing. These are a great stepping stone on the way to quitting
The pic is of a filter after 2 cigarettes. Gross!

Sweet and cheap
So this product is innovative. Nothing fancy, just a cheap piece of plastic. But is it efficient? Sure is! Everyone knows how terrible cigarettes are for you, the poison, the carcinogens, the TAR. What this little extension does is catch a small to moderate percentage of the tar as you inhale instead of putting it into your lungs. Catches some tar, that's it. But you can SEE it working.
Each piece works for about 4-8 cigarettes pending on what you smoke. It can work as an incentive to quit smoking, or, as is my case, I know a stubborn gent who has tried and tried to quit and simply can't. So simply put, I think these have the potential to delay serious health issues as it decreases the poison you put into your lungs per cigarette.
I highly recommend this product if you smoke or know someon Read full review
