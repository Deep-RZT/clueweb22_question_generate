Perhaps you have experienced credit problems, and are interested in rebuilding your credit score. Online instant credit businesses strive to meet these needs, but make sure you understand the potential pitfalls prior to opening an account.
What Is an Instant Credit Catalog?
Some catalog websites offer "instant" credit and operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Users apply for credit right on the site, and are often approved immediately, allowing them to begin shopping right away. Shoppers are encouraged to purchase home decor and furnishings, jewelry, clothes, computers and other items.
These credit programs are similar to traditional store credit cards in that they can only be used for purchases from the website or catalog that has issued the credit. The "buy now pay later" and "apply today buy today" messages are displayed prominently on the homepages of these sites, while information regarding interest rates, fees and other charges are found by scrolling to the bottom of the page and clicking on the small-print links.
Items purchased through these online catalogs are delivered quickly, and monthly payments spread out over time. These companies often extend credit to people who have had credit issues and can't get unsecured credit elsewhere, and may advertise that they help rebuild poor credit, as they report activity to three credit bureaus.
The higher risk of credit payment default is reflected in the high interest rates charged by the lender.
6 Online Instant Credit Websites
These six websites are examples of instant credit catalogs in the United States. Fingerhut also offers a print catalog which they will mail for a $2.00 fee, while USADiscounters offers automatic approval for military and civil service personnel.
How to Apply for Instant Credit
Many of these companies accept low income or bad credit histories and offer credit to high risk individuals. Most simply require that a person is not currently in bankruptcy, has a source of income, a valid email address and is a United States citizen currently residing in the country. To apply for instant credit, visit the selected website and provide your email address. You will then either be directed to an online form, or receive a customer number and link to an application form in your email inbox. Fill out the application including your full legal name, current address, income, asset and liability information, and submit it electronically.
Your application will then have a status of approved, not approved, or pending. If approved or pending you may be able to begin shopping immediately.
An instant credit catalog account can only be used for purchases from that particular website or company. They have higher-than-average interest rates and may also charge high shipping costs. In some cases they require a deposit on high-priced items, and then extend credit on the rest of the purchase. These accounts can require the account holder to pay a minimum monthly fee on a monthly payment plan. Instant credit companies usually charge high interest rates if the balance isn't paid in full each month. Actual interest rates can be difficult to find online and vary from catalog to catalog. Company websites often display tables showing sample monthly payments instead of advertising the interest rate.
Use caution if you are considering opening an instant credit account to fix poor credit. Opt for companies that don't require a purchase to open the account and if you do make a purchase pay it off in full and immediately close the account.
