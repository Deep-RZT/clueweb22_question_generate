Friend Holders and Filters
This popular Japanese manufacturer offers two filtration systems, a disposable cartridge filter with fibre filler and a permanent filter with a tar trap.  Though there is no perfectly safe smoke, it's important to note that the former filter reduces both nicotine and tar and the latter reduces only tar, though it does so quite effectively.  The permanent filter has a slight flavour advantage though the draw is tighter.  Our cleaning kit may be used on both styles - and is a must for the permanent series.
We our sad to say that the manufacturer has quick making these cartridges. Please consider the David Ross Brand Friend Replacement Fibre Filters
