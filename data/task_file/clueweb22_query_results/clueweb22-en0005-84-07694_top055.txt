Can these be used on an already filtered cigarette? I tried a tar block filter on my filtered cigarette and it just kept falling off.
This does happan occassionaly.  I've found that if hold your thumb &  forefinger partially on the tar block & the cigarette it solves that problem.  It's good to check this out right away because I've had cigerettes fall out of the tar block & burn holes in my clothing.
