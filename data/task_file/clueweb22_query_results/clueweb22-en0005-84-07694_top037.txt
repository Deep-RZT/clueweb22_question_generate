how does it work?
The inner filter allows only small particles of smoke with low molecular weight to pass through, which do not include the molecules of toxins and tar which are considered heavier. This reduces the amount of toxins and nicotine in each inhalation, thus reducing the desire and desire to smoke without damaging the taste of the cigarette
NIC- Out cigarette filter with a mechanical filtration system that is applied to the cigarette and selectively absorbs the large smoke particles of cigarette tar containing toxic compounds and other carcinogenic substances
The action principle of the nic-out filter is based on the gas engine’s gas behavior rules and has been developed in the framework of space technologies.

Great product! I've been smoking for 50 years, had a terrible wheez, and it's cleared up. Everyone at the bar now use them faithfully. Is it possible to make them using Hemp Plastic rather than chemical based plastic. Even baby bottles are under scrutiny these days. Are there any distribution territories available in Spanish speaking countries like Mexico, South America or Spain? Please advise and keep up the great work.
