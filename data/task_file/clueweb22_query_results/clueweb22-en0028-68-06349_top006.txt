Republicans splinter on how to handle a post-Roe world
The GOP is on different pages about a national abortion ban should the Supreme Court follow through. But pursuing one is certainly on the table.

The thing I’ll NEVER understand is how peeps on TV at the time compared this guy to John Dean

His testimony was nothing of the sort. Few specifics. Lot of snark. Ton of ambiguity. More questions than answers

Wonder if his book tells the story he held back during impeachment ->

in our original story, his spokesman specifically said: “McCarthy never said he’d call Trump to say he should resign”

that was a lie

when McCarthy put out a statement in his own name on Thurs, he didn’t correct it

he repeated the lie in angrier language

now he’s lying again twitter.com/mkraju/status/…

Now he has made it a centerpiece of his campaign to primary Gov Brian Kemp for certifying the legit result. No evidence of widespread fraud in GA. twitter.com/MurphyAJC/stat…

Not even in the top ten most important things about this reporting, which is of course true, but Trump’s backing of anyone for any race is about as firm as jello. If Trump was looking for pretense to edge away from McCarthy for Speaker, his remarks could be it.
