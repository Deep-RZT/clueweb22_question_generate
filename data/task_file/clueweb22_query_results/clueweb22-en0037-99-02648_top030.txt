Casares Costa Golf garden came about as one of the Costa del Sol’s premier residential areas.
In addition to a very fun course, Casares Costa Golf boasts a restaurant, golf academy, gym, beauty salon and an 18-hole footgolf course, allowing us to meet the different needs of all family members.
Our Golf Course
A 9-hole course designed by Juan Carlos Martínez, running through a gentle valley surrounded by vineyards, avocado and orange trees, and others typical of the Mediterranean forest. It has three par 3s, five par 4s, and one par 5, making up a course that has become very popular among Costa del Sol golfers thanks to its challenging layout.
