What they say
Testimonials from users
Viraj

My whole friend circle smokes, and everyone thinks that they're experts. But, no one had tried an activated charcoal filter before I introduced them to it, and now all of us can't smoke without it. 

(Some of them are no longer allowed to call themselves experts)

My wife is a crazy coffee lover and keeps trying to improve with funky beans, different roasts, and better equipment. I used to tease her obsessiveness, until she pointed out how I do the same with you guys. I've been trying different brands to figure out the perfect paper, the right filter for me, and treating myself to an absolutely sick rolling tray. Guilty as charged, I guess.

It's so convenient to order from you guys on text, thanks for all the product recommendations, especially my favourite new paper!

RollingFilters didn't just tell me why their filters result in a better smoking experience, they showed me - I'm so grateful for that!

Rolling Filters India
There’s a lot of smoke and mirrors in the toking world  – aggressive ads, gimmicks galore, and a perennial lack of substance. We get it – it’s a big marketplace, there’s gonna be lots of noise.
But we’re not participating in the madness. We’re not hard-selling, we’re not making memes everyday so you’ll remember us, and we’re not sending people paper if they tag us. We spent that time finding, importing, researching, and creating whatever it takes to get the cleanest toke possible. From the finest purveyors in Europe for activated charcoal and alfalfa to the highest quality local papers mills and manufacturers – we’re on it.
That’s why we’re the people sought out by the discerning smoker, the keen proponent, the enthusiast. The people who aspire to more. We’re the people who care.
We’re building an elevated ecosystem – come get high with us.
